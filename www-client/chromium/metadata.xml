    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    Chromium is a open-source web browser.

    For this ebuild fork, you can build 32 bit Chromium on 64 bit.  Multiple ABI
    installation is in testing.  This will allow to use binary only plugins that
    support a major ABI and allow to continue to use the experimental ABI as the
    default.

    You need to add the following in /etc/portage/profile/package.use.force
    in order to select a non-native ABI.  Tweak below to add your masked ABI.
    ----- CUT BELOW HERE -----
www-client/chromium -abi_x86_64 -abi_x86_32 -abi_x86_x32 -abi_mips_n64 -abi_ppc_64 -abi_s390_64
    ----- CUT ABOVE HERE -----

    To override the distro hard mask for ffmpeg5 do the following:

      mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile
      echo "www-client/chromium -system-ffmpeg" >> /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask

    Per-package environment variables:

    FORCE_LLVM_SLOT - Manually choose the LLVM slot to build with

    See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.env to set this up


    USE flag quality status:

      cfi - production ready
      thinlto-opt - works if enough total memory
      official - production ready previously but undergoing retesting
      pgo - production ready
      pgo-full - incomplete (undergoing rework for manual training)
      shadowcallstack - needs testing... not tested due to lack of hardware
        (report back if it works)

    Event based Full PGO (EPGO)

    Event based Full PGO (i.e. 1 step PGO) is not complete in this ebuild fork
    and is in development in the ebuild level.  PGO on *average* is 10%
    performance benefit relative to -O3.  (At the best case [or outlier cases],
    PGO can be +40% benefit but usually in atypical scenarios some of which are
    related to throughput.)
    

    If you choose to do the distro's Full PGO, it will double compilation time.
    What this means is if you built Chromium in 36 hrs expect it optimized in
    72 hours plus training time.  This implementation just does it passively,
    but the time to optimize is just 36 hours with some weeks we can skip
    instrumentation step.  When active training, the training step may take
    +20 minutes depending on how it was implemented.

    Steps required

      Just emerge as normal

    Most packagers would use test suites or just basic tasks.  When you do
    manual training, you can actually use it in the gaming context or your own
    personal situations.  An instrumented build doesn't typically feel noticably
    slower actually.

    It is strongly recommended to skip PGO because the sub seconds gains are not
    noticable for most people or use the prebuilt profile to cut PGOing time in
    1.x/2 time every single installation.  The blog entry below also mentions
    the 10% benefit consistent with ~10% on average observed by others.

    The blog entry below links to 1.3 seconds (FCP)!  So 10% of 1300 ms is
    130ms (or .13s) in reduction in delay.  Human reaction time is 250 ms.

    This ebuild fork version of PGO will allow reuse of generated profiles for
    the same BUILD in major.minor.build.patch.  The prebuilt profile is often
    reused between patch versions.

    Most ebuild developers use 3 step PGO in one emerge.  Every time a package
    is emerged, the standard PGO ebuild always runs 3 steps - instrument, train,
    rebuild on every emerge.   In this implementation, we run always 1 step but
    we schedule based on events.  When a version change happens we instrument.
    When the right combo is present (profile, same compiler, same build number),
    we use optimized rebuild.  The idea is to maximize enjoyment of the product
    but that can only happen when we actually use the product.  Adding more
    build time decreases enjoyment.  The training step is done passively, so
    can enjoy and train at the same time uninterrupted.

    PartitionAlloc - a secure allocator

      Chromium uses PartitionAlloc as the default allocator.  It's designed for
      security to avoid type confusion attacks and lower latency, and benefits
      the most from memory use effiency.  It's the default in 92 and later.
      There is no current way to switch back to the OS allocator.


    Build time environment variables:

      APPLY_OILEDMACHINE_OVERLAY_PATCHSET - Apply the following patches:
      - Allow for Qt6 build without Qt5.
      - Allow to disable SIMD for zlib.
      Valid values:  1 - apply (default), 0 - do not apply

    <flag name="bluetooth">
      Adds support for GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) for the Web Bluetooth
      API.
    </flag>
    <flag name="branch-protection">
      Enables branch protection features (available on armv8.5 [arm64] and above
      only) which are enabled by default.  If you disable the official USE flag,
      you may customize it via CFLAGS with your preference prioritized more than
      the official settings.
    </flag>
    <flag name="bundled-libcxx">
      Build against the internal libc++ for proper cfi-icall and cfi-icast
      protection.  This also builds libcxx with CFI, Full RELRO, noexecstack,
      SSP security features.  This is the upstream default.
    </flag>
    <flag name="cfi">
      cfi-cast:
      Compile the build with mitigation against possible bad casting
      vulnerabilities.  When a violation is encountered, the program aborts.

      cfi-icall:
      Compile the build with bad function cast checks and non static function
      pointers checks.  When a violation is encountered, the program aborts.

      cfi-vcall:
      Compile the build with Clang Control Flow Integrity (CFI) security
      protections to mitigate against arbitrary code execution caused by from
      memory corruption attempts from forward edge attacks from virtual
      functions.  For backward edge protection see shadowcallstack USE flag.
      The estimated impact is around 1% CPU overhead, around 15% or less code
      size increase.  When a violation is encountered, the program aborts.

      The abort is a way to halt more dangerous code execution.

      shadow-call-stack:
      Allows for backward edge protections against return address overwrites
      that could lead to arbitrary code execution.  (Experimental, arm64 only)
      Use -fsanitize=shadow-call-stack to activate this protection.

      Arm64 users, see also the branch-protection USE flag.

      Additional ebuild per-package environment variables if USE=-official:

        USE_CFI_ICALL - 1 to enable, 0 to disable cfi-icall
        USE_CFI_CAST - 1 to enable, 0 to disable cfi-cast

      For the official build settings, it is fixed based on the ABI.

      For x86-64 it is cfi-vcall=true, cfi-icall=true, cfi-cast=false
      All other microarches are all false, but you may customize via the
      -fsanitize= compiler flag with the cfi USE flag.

    <flag name="ebolt">
      Use the event based BOLT to optimize the package. (EXPERIMENTAL)
      This will optimize the layout of the program to make better utilization
      of cache use and branch prediction.  BOLT benefits the most for
      programs with 100+ MB in size.

      Requires Java.
    </flag>
    <flag name="official">
      Enable the use of official build settings [similar to the official bin but
      without branding] instead of the developer build settings.  Enables
      security hardending (for both the browser and internal bundled third party
      dependencies built with the stronger CFI Basic mode with cfi-vcall and
