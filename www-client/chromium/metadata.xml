    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    Chromium is a open-source web browser.

    For this ebuild fork, you can build 32 bit Chromium on 64 bit.  Multiple ABI
    installation is in testing.  This will allow to use binary only plugins that
    support a major ABI and allow to continue to use the experimental ABI as the
    default.

    You need to add the following in /etc/portage/profile/package.use.force
    in order to select a non-native ABI.  Tweak below to add your masked ABI.
    - CUT BELOW HERE -
www-client/chromium -abi_x86_64 -abi_x86_32 -abi_x86_x32 -abi_mips_n64 -abi_ppc_64 -abi_s390_64
    - CUT ABOVE HERE -

    To override the distro hard mask for ffmpeg5 do the following:

      mkdir -p /etc/portage/profile
      Add "www-client/chromium -system-ffmpeg" to /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask


    Per-package environment variables:

    FORCE_LLVM_SLOT - Manually choose the LLVM slot to build with

    See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.env to set this up

    MITIGATION_USE_CASE - Sets the safety period for ebuild (re-)installs.  If
    the duration exceeds, the ebuild will not (re-)install until a newer point
    release is provided by upstream.
    Valid values:
      donations - 1 week
      email     - 1 week
      legal     - 1 week
      money     - 1 week
      shopping  - 1 week
      socials   - 2 weeks (ebuild default)
      default   - 30 days
    Examples:
      MITIGATION_USE_CASE="shopping"           # The ebuild is (re-)installable for 1 week from release date.
      MITIGATION_USE_CASE="donations socials"  # The ebuild is (re-)installable for 1 week from release date.
      MITIGATION_USE_CASE="socials"            # The ebuild is (re-)installable for 2 weeks from release date.
      MITIGATION_USE_CASE="default"            # The ebuild is (re-)installable for 30 days from release date but may likely contain vulnerabilities.


    USE flag quality status:

      cfi - production ready
      mold - production ready
      official - production ready previously but undergoing retesting
      pgo - production ready
      qt6 - production ready
      shadowcallstack - needs testing... not tested due to lack of hardware
        (report back if it works)
      thinlto-opt - works if enough total memory


    PartitionAlloc - a secure allocator

      Chromium uses PartitionAlloc as the default allocator.  It's designed for
      security to avoid type confusion attacks and lower latency, and benefits
      the most from memory use effiency.  It's the default in 92 and later.
      There is no current way to switch back to the OS allocator.


    The -Oshit optimization flag:

    The flag will address the unacceptable build times.

    This is the introduction of the -Oshit compiler metaflag, which only exists in this
    ebuild.

    -Oshit will build mostly everything with -O1 for _FORTIFY_SOURCE and faster
    build speed but will have extra environment variables to customize the
    optimization level of those that have a perceived performance drop or
    are possibly performance sensitive.  A noticable perceived performance drop
    is where one notices jitter, studder, skipping, double processing time,
    latency larger than the 3 second rule, etc.
    Projects that may override O1 will be prefixed with OSHIT_OPT_LEVEL_
    environment variable listed below.  These environment variables should
    be placed in a per-package env file.

    Example:

    Contents of /etc/portage/env/chromium.conf:

      CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -Oshit"
      CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -Oshit"
      FEATURES="${FEATURES} ccache"
      OSHIT_OPT_LEVEL_DAV1D="2"

    Contents of /etc/portage/package.env:

      www-client/chromium chromium.conf
    


    Build time environment variables:

      - Allow for Qt6 build without Qt5.
      - Allow to disable SIMD for zlib for compatibility with older CPUs.
      - Allow to change the v8 optimization level to -O2 or -O3
      - Add mold linker support

      Valid values:

        1 - apply (default)
        0 - do not apply


      PRINT_PREVIEW - Allow print preview

    Proposals for next ebuild change(s):

    Investigate -pgo USE flag should be a greater than 4 cpu core requirement.
    The next build will measure the build time of pgo disabled.

    Intestigate shuffle-sections ROP mitigation.

  </upstream>
  <use>
    <flag name="async-dns">
      Enable the Async DNS feature.  Enabling may bypass the system's DNS
      resolver and DNS filtering packages.  (DISABLING IS EXPERIMENTAL OR
      UNDER RESEARCH)
    </flag>
    <flag name="bluetooth">
      Adds support for websites to communicate with Bluetooth wireless devices
      and support for GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) for the Web Bluetooth
      API.
    </flag>
    <flag name="bundled-libcxx">
      Build against the internal libc++ for proper cfi-icall and cfi-icast
      protection.  This also builds libcxx with CFI, Full RELRO, noexecstack,
      SSP security features.  This is the upstream default.
    </flag>
    <flag name="cet">
      Provide some CET protection to the V8 JavaScript engine.  (EXPERIMENTAL)
    </flag>
    <flag name="cfi">
      cfi-cast:
      Compile the build with mitigation against possible bad casting
      vulnerabilities.  When a violation is encountered, the program aborts.

      cfi-icall:
      Compile the build with bad function cast checks and non static function
      pointers checks.  When a violation is encountered, the program aborts.

      cfi-vcall:
      Compile the build with Clang Control Flow Integrity (CFI) security
      protections to mitigate against arbitrary code execution caused by from
      memory corruption attempts from forward edge attacks from virtual
      functions.  For backward edge protection see shadowcallstack USE flag.
      The estimated impact is around 1% CPU overhead, around 15% or less code
      size increase.  When a violation is encountered, the program aborts.

      The abort is a way to halt more dangerous code execution.

      shadow-call-stack:
      Allows for backward edge protections against return address overwrites
      that could lead to arbitrary code execution.  (Experimental, arm64 only)
      Use -fsanitize=shadow-call-stack to activate this protection.

      Arm64 users, see also the branch-protection USE flag.

      Additional ebuild per-package environment variables if USE=-official:

        USE_CFI_ICALL - 1 to enable, 0 to disable cfi-icall
        USE_CFI_CAST - 1 to enable, 0 to disable cfi-cast

      For the official build settings, it is fixed based on the ABI.

      For x86-64 it is cfi-vcall=true, cfi-icall=true, cfi-cast=false
      All other microarches are all false, but you may customize via the
      -fsanitize= compiler flag with the cfi USE flag.

      Enabling may decrease performance (w/o PGO) and increase vulnerabilities
      (w/o Clang CFI).

      Use the system-clang and system-rust instead of the bundled one.

      If disabled, it will build with a pre-stable build of Clang and a post
      snapshot of Rust.

    <flag name="system-zlib">
      Use system zlib instead of the bundled one

      The internal vendored version is SIMD optimized but the vanilla zlib provided
      by the system is not.

      Enabling may decrease performance (w/o PGO) and increase vulnerabilities
      (w/o Clang CFI).

    <flag name="thinlto-opt">
      Enables selective ThinLTO -O2 optimizations for the browser binary and
      other targets while others use the default --lto-O0.  This optimization
      is not enabled by default upstream due to increased binary size concerns.
      Building may required 12 GiB total memory minimal for dedicated compile
      only machines, but 16 GiB total memory recommended for multitasking
      builder machines.
