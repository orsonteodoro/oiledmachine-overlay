This ebuild fork is kept in sync with the gentoo overlay.  We use
the vanilla package and add on top of it with multilib changes.


Estimated modding times:

Simple update: less than 30 minutes
Worst case for missing multilib compat patch:  3 days to 1 week
Estimated build time is 3-4 days to build 2 ABIs.


Update checklist:

Make sure you are using ccache first and it works.  This will
cut down on rebuild times from several days to a few minutes.

RDEPEND and DEPEND must have MULTILIB_USEDEP for all packages
dependencies that are multilib capable for simplicity and less
build time failure chance.

Make sure that the versions of the dependencies are the same.  It is easier
to just copy the ebuild and apply changes.

If a package is in a *-libs category and is not multilib ready,
the ebuild most likely be forked and rebuilt as multilib.

IUSE must be modded with ABI USE flags.

inherit multilib-minimal must be added.

The recurrence interval for a critical vulnerability can vary.
The worst case is between 1 week for critical vulnerabilities and
best case is ~6 months.  For a high vulnerability CVSS 3.x score,
the recurrence interval is around 2 weeks.  It's recommended to
use only the stable KEYWORDed version unless that keyworded
version has a vulnerability advisory.

Three NVD keywords must be tracked: chrome, chromium, "v8 chrome".

The ebuild must be updated every critical vulnerability and old ebuilds
removed.

Some phase functions must be prefixed multilib_ from src_configure
to src_install.

The multilib_copy_sources must be called in src_prepare.

The src_configure parts related to target_cpu to target the ABI must be
transferred between point releases.

The wrapper scripts and .desktop files should be distingishable between ABIs.

The files folders containing patches, wrappers, etc must be kept in
sync also with the gentoo overlay.


Additional notes:

It helps to diff between the forked version and the same
point release so see what changes need to be migrated.

It also helps to do a side-by-side comparison to migrate
changes.
