Keeping these ebuild requires takes a lot of time.  The vanilla ebuilds used are
same as the gentoo overlay which get modified with multilib changes.  We
use the vanilla ebuilds because the (R)DEPENDs are updated by them and cut
down the maintenance cost a bit.

Due to time to compile and time it takes to migrate changes, there may be large
lag time between Gentoo's release and the one found on oiledmachine-overlay.


Here is the checklist if you are maintaining your own multilib fork:

It helps if you diff it with the same ebuild point release to see which parts
of the ebuild/package got added or changed.

Make sure that (R)DEPENDs have MULTILIB_USEDEP for all libraries and programs
that have it.

Make sure that the inherit adds multilib-minimal.

Make sure that the functions call the src_ and pkg_ functions get
prefixed with multilib_.

If a new library (in categories *-libs) is used without supporting multilib,
the ebuild it needs to be forked to make it multilib ready.

Make sure that the binary is properly built with the right multilib
toolchain and libraries and the CHOST for the ABI is used.

Make sure all wrappers use the respected multilib versions.

Make sure that _fix_paths gets copied and called so that the VARIABLES and
toolchain get built with the proper values and programs.

Make sure that the eclasses are in kept in sync with gentoo overlay and
have multilib changes.

Important:  Due to the large codebase and internal libraries, the ebuild
needs to be updated every critical vulnerability and that ebuild and earlier
be removed.  The reoccurance interval is about a month between criticals
and high.  Currently is +85 days from May 26, 2020.

Verify in the About > Help that you are using the 32-bit version or non-native
ABI version.

Make sure that all cargo parts get built for the respective target ABI.
Do:
`grep -F -r -e "TARGET = Some(\"x86_64-unknown-linux-g" /var/tmp/portage/www-client/firefox-79.0-r3/temp/build.log`,
replacing x86_64 with the one returned by get `$(get_abi_CHOST ${ABI} | cut -f 1 -d "-")`,
and to see if it is in compile phase of x86.  If it is, the cross compiling is broken.

Make sure no other -m64 gets mixed with -m32 (should be the same ABI) in the compiling phase.
It must be the same ABI throughout the phase.
