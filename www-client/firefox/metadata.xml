  Firefox is an HTML5 compatible web browser.

  This ebuild fork allows you to build 32 bit Firefox under 64 bit.  You can
  choose multiple ABIs.  This will allow you to support running (binary only or
  DRM [Digital Rights Management]) plugins that only support one particular
  major ABI.

  Benchmarks have shown reduced memory usage 10s-100s MB saved for running the
  32 bit version compared to 64 bit version.
	
  You need to add the following in /etc/portage/profile/package.use.force in
  order to select a non-native ABI.  Tweak below to add your masked ABI.
  ----- CUT BELOW HERE -----
www-client/firefox -abi_x86_64 -abi_x86_32 -abi_x86_x32 -abi_mips_n64 -abi_ppc_64 -abi_s390_64
  ----- CUT ABOVE HERE -----

  Due to constraints in the package manager spec if both ESR and rapid have the
  same version numbers, the e suffix in this overlay is refers to ESR.

<use>
  <flag name="bindist">
    Disable official Firefox branding (icons, name) which are not
    binary-redistributable according to upstream.
  </flag>
  <flag name="ebolt">
    Use event based BOLT to optimize the cache use and branch prediction of
    this package.  (EXPERIMENTAL)
  </flag>
  <flag name="eme-free">
    Disable EME (DRM plugin) cabability at build time
  </flag>
  <flag name="ffvpx">
    Essentially a minimalst fork of ffmpeg 5.x without non-free codecs and
    only necessary codecs for decode.  Codecs supported for 64-bit:  vpx{8,9},
    av1, opus, flac.  Codecs supported for 32-bit:  flac.  This has a higher
    precedence than the system-ffmpeg.
  </flag>
  <flag name="jemalloc">
    Uses a memory allocator that will result in decreased memory consumption;
    otherwise, it will use the default Linux allocator.  For this ebuild it is
    recommended to turn jemalloc off as it may be more stable in the worst case
    high memory usage case.

  <flag name="geckodriver">
    Enable WebDriver support
  </flag>
  <flag name="gmp-autoupdate">
    Allow Gecko Media Plugins (binary blobs) to be automatically downloaded and
    kept up-to-date in user profiles
  </flag>
  <flag name="hwaccel">
    Force-enable hardware-accelerated rendering (Mozilla bug 594876)

    Enable sound events support for browser dialogs and menu popups.
  </flag>
  <flag name="mold">
    Enable use of the mold linker with met non-commercial preconditions.
  </flag>
  <flag name="openh264">
    Use <pkg>media-libs/openh264</pkg> for H.264 support instead of downloading
    binary blob from Mozilla at runtime.  It is recommended to use the binary
    blob to avoid possible royalty fees.  See Wikipedia article.
  </flag>
  <flag name="pgo">
    Add support for profile-guided optimization using gcc-4.5, for faster
    binaries. This option will double the compile time.
  </flag>
  <flag name="proprietary-codecs">
    Enables use of non-free patent-encumbered audio and video formats, and
    network protocols.  Upstream build files associate AAC, H264, and others
    as proprietary.

  <flag name="proprietary-codecs-disable">
    (USE FLAG IN DEVELOPMENT)

    If enabled, it will disable codecs or network protocols with a patent
    status that is not free in this ebuild fork.

    With this flag enabled, this may break dependencies that assume previous
    unpatched behavior.

    In general a codec is allowed to be built into disabled proprietary-codecs
    build if the patent status is one of the following:

      (1) Expired patent, typically 20 years.  (e.g. MP3)
      (2) Similar perpetual royalty-free freedoms like the
          Grant of Patent License in the Apache 2.0. (e.g. libvpx, libaom)

    AND

      The code is free with a widely used compatible open source license.

    AND CONDITIONALLY

      The codec may allowed in this ebuild fork if it doesn't require a
      non-free developer license in a case-by-case basis.
