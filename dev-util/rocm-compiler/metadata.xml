  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  The ebuilds are slotted to support GPU offloading for ebuilds that prefer
  it through the system's llvm or through the ROCm fork of llvm.

  This ebuild is to ensure that the entire slot has a consistent choice.

  <use>
    <flag name="system-llvm">
      Use the system clang/llvm packages instead of the ROCm forks at the
      expense of minor version availability.  This also controls which libomp
      does GPU offloading which may be chosen differently per slot.

      Setting this to disable may have early access to GPU offloading for newer
      GPUs.
