NVIDIA AI Foundation Models Community License Agreement
IMPORTANT NOTICE – PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE USING THE NVIDIA AI FOUNDATION MODELS.
This license agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you, whether an individual or entity (“you”)
and NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) and governs the use of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, consisting of models
including software, checkpoints, learnt weights, algorithms, parameters, configuration files, datasets and
documentation, if and when available (collectively, “NVIDIA AI Foundation Models”).
This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the NVIDIA AI
Foundation Models are used.
If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, do not use the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models.
1. License Grant.
1.1 Grants. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, nontransferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly granted in this Agreement), license to:
1.1.1 For non-production use without an NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription: (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA
AI Foundation Models, and (b) create Derivative Models (as defined below), all the foregoing for non-production
uses, including test and evaluation uses; and
1.1.2 For production use with an NVIDIA AI Enterprise subscription: (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI
Foundation Models, (b) create Derivative Models (as defined below), (c) deploy NVIDIA AI Foundation Models,

service, without distributing NVIDIA AI Foundation Models and Derivative Models, and (d) distribute the NVIDIA
AI Foundation Models or Derivative Models in each case with a copy of this Agreement, all the foregoing in
production uses in combination with an NVIDIA NIM (an NVIDIA inference microservice runtime), available
through a paid subscription of NVIDIA AI Enterprise except as otherwise expressly permitted in section 1.1.3.
Contact NVIDIA sales for NVIDIA AI Enterprise (see https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/aienterprise/).
1.1.3 For production use on PCs or workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs without an NVIDIA AI Enterprise
subscription: (a) install and use copies of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, (b) create Derivative Models (as

1.2 Limited Grants. The grants above are further limited as follows:
1.2.1 You may use certain NVIDIA AI Foundation Models to create a Custom TTS Application for your own use but
cannot offer it as a service to third parties or distribute the Custom TTS Application. You acknowledge and agree
that it is your obligation to have sufficient rights or licenses for content used with a Custom TTS Application to
generate new content. “Custom TTS Application” means a custom text-to-speech application that enables the
creation of synthetic voice output that resembles an input voice.
“Derivative Models” mean all derivatives, adaptations, extensions or enhancements to the NVIDIA AI Foundation
Models, works based on the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, or any other model which is created or initialized by
transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, to the
other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, including
- but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based
on the generation of synthetic data by the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models for training the other model.
2. Use and Distribution. The following terms apply to the use or distribution of the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models
and Derivative Models you develop as authorized in Section 1, and you are responsible for the consequences of
non-conformance with these terms:
