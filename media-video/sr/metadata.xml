    VESPCN/VSRNet known issue

  Further reading:

    PSNRs:  https://github.com/HighVoltageRocknRoll/sr#benchmark-results
    Descriptions:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_super-resolution

  Note:

    The PSNR may be used to measure image quality with many sources implying
    that higher values are better, but the number is doesn't always correlate to
    what you see.  Always check the image visually to confirm.  A value of ~1.5
    PSNR difference may have significantly different quality results.  Wikipedia
    also noted that validity of PSNR is correct only for same codec and same
    image.
