  The oiledmachine-overlay provides this ebuild for PGO/BOLT optimization.

  USE flag status:

    pgo - done
    bolt - done


  BOLT/PGO optimization requires several steps:

  (1) Fetch assets to train with.  They should be licensed under public-domain,
      CC0-1.0, or your own assets.  They need to be 60 fps, 4k, and at least 5
      seconds long for video PGO training.

      For audio training, pick 3 samples 15 seconds each.

      These high quality samples will be used to generate lower quality samples.
      The long 30 second requirement is to ensure sufficient coverage of dynamic
      range.  In addition, the sample will decide the code paths of the chroma
      subsample to train.

  (2) Emerge FFmpeg the first time to get the PGO toolchain installed.

  (3) Configure the following variables, replacing i with a unpadded number

        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_CGI_i               # Computer Generated Imagery
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_SCREENCAST_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_FANTASY_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_GAMING_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_GRAINY_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_REALISM_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_STILL_i             # Same image used from start to finish in podcasting or music
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_VOICE_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_RADIO_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_MUSIC_INSTRUMENTAL_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_VOCAL_MUSIC_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_AV_DEVICE_i
        FFMPEG_TRAINING_AV_MICROPHONE_i

      to the abspath to your asset(s). Only one asset can be used for each
      variable.  The reason for the long list is to ensure dynamic range
      coverage based on typical use.  One may add samples across decades, across
      genres, across live or studio so that the codecs do not get parts
      deoptimized in the PGO process.  It is unnecessary to fill all of them
      out.  For example one may inadvertantly optimize for 60s music once only.
      These allow to specify more so that contemporary music or scenarios also
      gets optimized.  One may inadvertantly cover women radio quality but
      inadvertantly deoptimize for male or lgtbtqia.

  (4) Setup FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_CODECS, FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_CODECS,
      FFMPEG_TRAINING_CODECNAME_ARGS, FFMPEG_TRAINING_CODECNAME_ARGS_LOSSLESS,
      per-package envvars.  See below for details.

  (5) Emerge FFmpeg again with an optimized PGO build.

  (Planning) FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_STREAMING_i is the v4l device to train for
  codec streaming.

  (Planning) FFMPEG_TRAINING_MOBILE_STREAMING_i is a sample for mobile
  training.

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_MAX_ASSETS_PER_TYPE is a number of assets per *_i type.
  Currently it is set to 100 but can be expanded to more than
  that.
	
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_CODECS is a string separated list of elements.
  Each element is in this format vscenario:vencoder:vdecoder:ext:tags.
  Empty elements are shown as :: for inner or : for outer.

    The value of vscenario can be fantasy, film, grainy, streaming, realism.
    The value of vencoder matches  ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E -e "[D.][E][V][I.][L.][S.] .*" in parens
    The value of vdecoder matches  mpv ~~vd=help ; replace ~~ with double hyphens
    The value of ext matches  ffmpeg -formats
    The value of tags may be added for custom trainers providing metadata
    for enablement of special optimization options.  Multiple tags
    may be appended by comma and spaces replaced with _.  Tags can
    be filtered with bash regex to apply extra args.

    * VA-API codecs are currently not supported for training in the ebuild level.

    Example
	
      FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_CODECS=" fantasy:libvpx-vp9:libvpx-vp9:webm: realism:libvpx-vp9:libvpx-vp9:webm:"

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_CODECS is a string separated list of elements.
  Each element is in this format ascenario:aencoder:adecoder:ext:tags.
  Empty elements are shown as :: for inner or : for outer.

    The value of ascenario can be voice, radio, music.
    The value of aencoder matches  ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E -e "[D.][E][A][I.][L.][S.] .*" in parens
    The value of adecoder matches  mpv ~~ad=help ; replace ~~ with double hyphens
    The value of ext matches  ffmpeg -formats
    The value of tags may be added for custom trainers providing metadata
    for enablement of special optimization options.  Multiple tags
    may be appended by comma and spaces replaced with _.  Tags can
    be filtered with bash regex to apply extra args.

    Each codec can be supplied additional per-package envvar args to
    pass to ffmpeg in this general form:

      FFMPEG_TRAINING_CODECNAME_ARGS
      FFMPEG_TRAINING_CODECNAME_ARGS_LOSSLESS

    Example

      FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_CODECS=" voice:libopus:libopus:webm: music:libvorbis:libvorbis:ogg:high_profile"

    replacing CODECNAME with uppercases and hyphens with underscores.
    For example, if one wanted to train an imaginary codec libfoo-bar,
    you need to set the variables FFMPEG_TRAINING_LIBFOO_BAR_ARGS
    or FFMPEG_TRAINING_LIBFOO_BAR_ARGS_LOSSLESS.  These args correspond to
    additional  ffmpeg -h full  codec settings for that codec.  You
    should change them to the type of performance or quality settings
    you want to use typically.  Setting the -crf or the -threads is
    something you should set.

  The variables with _LOSSLESS suffix should only add arguments that
  modify performance and not the framerate or quality.

  Both FFMPEG_TRAINING_VIDEO_CODECS and FFMPEG_TRAINING_AUDIO_CODECS are for
  use only for the ffmpeg codebase.  Using another external codec
  in an external ebuild requires that ebuild be modified for
  PGO.

  The cbr and vbr trainers for audio PGO training have additional
  envvars.  Let's pretend that there is an imaginary codec called
  foo.  Foo supports bitrates between 64 and 1411.  We can support
  only discrete values for PGO training.

  # Use this to support 64 kbps, 128 kbps, 256 kbps, 320 kbps, 1411 kbps
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_CBR_TABLE_FOO_MUSIC="128 256 320 1411"
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_CBR_TABLE_FOO_RADIO="64"
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_CBR_TABLE_FOO_VOICE="32"

  The codec will match the suffix with the asset scenario to
  not waste time on unlikely parings encountered in the real world.

  Foo also can be used for VBR encoding.  The user needs to supply
  the ffmpeg option and the value.

  # Train with -vbr 1, -vbr 2, -vbr 3, -vbr 4
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_VBR_OPTION_FOO="-vbr"
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_VBR_TABLE_LIBFOO_FOO_MUSIC="7 8 9"
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_VBR_TABLE_LIBFOO_FOO_RADIO="2 3"

  It is recommended to only train codecs that reflect typical use.
  Not doing so will result in increased code size and performance
  degradation.


  Audio Video (AV) capture training (Work in Progress)

  Do not use the USE=trainer-av-streaming this feature until portage is
  patched with mitigations.

  This is accessible via the trainer-av-streaming USE flag.  Note
  it will require access to either camera, X11, or KMS.  The reason why
  is to reduce CPU load that may result in decoding other assets and
  to similate or replicate the conditions similar to live streaming.

  It also requires some permission changes for the portage account
  such as either adding portage to video group or changing the /dev/video*
  device with +rw ACL changes for portage in order to capture from the
  camera.  These should be temporary changes and the permitted
  permissions should be removed after training.  It also requires
  FEATURES="${FEATURES} -ipc-sandbox -pid-sandbox" permissions in order
  to train for a screencasting scenario.  When performing screencasting
  training (which is always enabled), it will take a grab of the screen
  which is a big security/privacy issue.  When portage is fixed with
  trap INT, trap QUIT, trap HUP, etc support, some mitigation can be
  achieved but not total especially in brownout or low battery
  situation.  It is recommended to only use this training only during
  a single user controlled setting when passwords, private accounts,
  personal identifiable information are not being used or not being
  exposed.
	

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_AV_CODECS must be set as a space separated list of elements.

    Each element of FFMPEG_TRAINING_AV_CODECS is in the format

      avscenario:vencoder:vdecoder:aencoder:adecoder:container:tags

    Empty elements are shown as :: for inner or : for outer.

    The value of avscenario can be live-streaming
    The value of vencoder matches  ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E -e "[D.][E][V][I.][L.][S.] .*" in parens
    The value of vdecoder matches  mpv ~~vd=help ; replace ~~ with double hyphens.  you may specify none.
    The value of aencoder matches  ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E -e "[D.][E][A][I.][L.][S.] .*" in parens
    The value of adecoder matches  mpv ~~ad=help ; replace ~~ with double hyphens.  you may specify none.
    The value of container matches  ffmpeg -formats ; if you don't know put unknown.
    The value of tags may be added for custom trainers providing metadata
    for enablement of special optimization options.  Multiple tags
    may be appended by comma and spaces replaced with _.  Tags can
    be filtered with bash regex to apply extra args.

    * The decoders may be used in the future for simulating video conferencing
    * The avscenario may be expanded to include video-conferencing.
    * live-streaming assumes client side only.  No network training currently.
    * The permissions for /dev/video* require either portage be in the video
      group or Access Control List (ACL) of the /dev/video* have portage with
      rw- permission in order to to do training with the capture device.
	  
    See the above section how to setup these variables.


  AV environment variables

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_STREAMING_UPLOAD_BANDWIDTH - Upload bandwidth in Mbps
  (megabits) that the host machine supports.  Anything exceeding that
  will not be trained.  Decimal values supported.

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_AV_STREAMING_WS - This is a weighted function formula
  that uses a weighted sum for sorting recommendations.  You must
  place the formula in single quotes.  This can be used to control the
  recommended codec or preference for FPS or quality or other aspects
  based on sum of subscores.  The score without your formula is maxed out
  at less than the approaching 60000 Kbps corresponding to total_bitrate.
  If the term exceeds that number, then it is a dominator term and has
  more influence over sorting the list with higher scores climbing to
  more to the top of recommended.  The idea is to boost the score of
  aspects that you are more interested in.  Some people are more
  interested in audio.  Others may be interested in video quality.
  Some may prefer FPS over video quality or vice-versa.

  Available variables:

    ${abitrate}      - audio bitrate in kbps.  Some sites cap it at 256 kbps.
    ${asample_rate}  - audio sample rate.  Some sites cap it at 44.8 kHz.
    ${vquality}      - 1 for low, 2 for mid, 3 for high video quality
    ${is_30fps}      - 1 for true
    ${is_60fps}      - 1 for true
    ${fps}           - frames per second.  Max is 60
    ${mic}           - 1 for true
    ${total_bitrate} - in kbps summing the audio and video bitrates

    * It is recommended to normalize the variables from [0,1].
    * It may be left unset, it will fall back to the total bitrate.
    * If set, the score formula is replaced with your formula starting
      at zero score.
    * Have at least one term dominating the total_bitrate in order
      to be satisfied about recommendation sorting.  Total bitrates
      may range from 6000 to 60000 for live streaming.
    * You may want to leave the total_bitrate in so that the worst case
      sorting if all other terms are zeroed or are too small, it can be
      still be sorted in a satisfactory way with it as fallback, or
      as a way to break ties with scores sharing the same score
      with just dominating factors.  If all scores are the same 60000,
      the total_bitrate term can break theses ties.

  General formula:
  score = a_1*x_1 + a_2*x_2 + .... + a_n*x_n, where a_i are weights and x_i
  are one of the variables above of your choosing.

  Example

    FFMPEG_TRAINING_AV_STREAMING_WS='200000*${is_60fps} + 100000*(${aquality}/3) + ${total_bitrate}'

  This formula just says I like 60 fps more than quality.


  Custom training resolutions

  Set FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_VOD_RESOLUTIONS as a space separated list of
  sublists to control training Video On Demand (VOD).  Use
  FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_VOD_RESOLUTIONS_QUICK for the quick trainers.

  Sublist format:

    fps;width;height;dynamic_range

  dynamic range - sdr or hdr only
  fps - 24, 25, 30, or 60 mostly.

  Examples

    FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_VOD_RESOLUTIONS="30;1280;720;sdr 60;1280;720;sdr"
    FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_VOD_RESOLUTIONS_QUICK="30;1280;720;sdr 60;1280;720;sdr"
    FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_VOD_RESOLUTIONS_QUICK="30;1920;1080;hdr 60;1920;1080;hdr"

  Set FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_STREAMING_RESOLUTIONS as a space separated
  list of sublists for level of detail for streaming:

  Sublist format:

    fps;width;height;bitrate;sample_rate;microphone

  Example

    FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_STREAMING_RESOLUTIONS="30;1980;1080;128;44.1;1 30;640;360;128;44.1;1"	

  bitrate is in Kbps (kilobits per second).
  sample rate is in kHZ (kilohertz).

  Setting this will override the defaults which trains all.


  Environment variables related to training

  The following are customizable

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_264_HW_LEVEL_SUPPORTED - A space delimited list of hw
  supported levels.  Check the technical manual for details.

  FFMPEG_TRAINING_256_PRESET - A string representing speed to compression
  ratio.  See the wiki for details under preset.  (This may be changed or
  removed and appied to FFMPEG_TRAINING_CUSTOM_STREAMING_RESOLUTIONS
  instead).  Currently allowed only for trainer-av-streaming USE flag.

    Examples

      FFMPEG_TRAINING_256_PRESET="superfast" # blocky artifacts
      FFMPEG_TRAINING_256_PRESET="ultrafast" # unsharp edges but fast encoding
      FFMPEG_TRAINING_256_PRESET="medium" # default

  FFMPEG_TRAINER_VAAPI_SCALE_ALG - Choose either CPU or GPU
  VA-API scaling.  Acceptable values:  gpu (default), igp, cpu.


  Custom training

  Since it would be impratical to permute and PGO train all the possible
  features and settings of the software, customized PGO training is
  provided (See README.md of overlay) to allow people to script their own
  trainers.  You may also define additional per-package environment
  variable assigned assets.  See the ebuild for ways to use the
  variables.


  Decrapifying

  The FFmpeg package is known to keep around codecs created as far back as the
  80s and 90s and more and more over time keep being added.  From the distro
  perspective, having these old formats around is counter to the aesthetic.
  From the younger audience point of view, these older codecs are never going to
  be used by most.  From a security standpoint, it presents a security risk as
  the attack surface is increased.  Some options are also being buried or denied
  being toggled for unknown reasons, or you just don't like what the packager
  maintainer is doing.  The bad side of uncrapifying is that it may also may
  break software that depends on FFmpeg.  The next per-package environment
  variable addresses these issues.

  FFMPEG_CUSTOM_OPTIONS - a space separated list of *_encoders, *_decoders,
  *_muxers, *_demuxers, *_parsers, *_protocols, *_bsfs, *_indevs, *_outdevs to
  blacklist or whitelist.  Options prefixed with a - are disabled.  These can be
  case insensitive or in raw form with the CONFIG_ prefix.  See the following
  links:

  For bsfs, codecs, parsers, protocols see:

       https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavcodec/Makefile

  Note the subsection section in the above link is can be added and
  should be considered for FFMPEG_CUSTOM_OPTIONS.

  For containers see:

       https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavformat/Makefile

  For devices see:

       https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavdevice/Makefile

  For filters see:

       https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavfilter/Makefile

  For the dependency chain see:

       https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/configure

  These options may need to be customized exactly per major.minor version.

  These have absolute control and are evaluated at the end just before writing
  out the config.mak.

  You can use the clear-config-first USE flag to disable all flags first
  before whitelisting.

  You may encounter visibility, naming inconsistencies, or config dependency
  isssues.  Check if the option is inside the file.  Also, see the association
  between the missing symbol, the .o file, and the CONFIG_* option to ultimately
  whitelist the CONFIG_ option that is causing the missing symbol.

  Examples:

       FFMPEG_CUSTOM_OPTIONS="
           -CONFIG_LIBVPX_VP8_DECODER
           -CONFIG_LIBVPX_VP8_ENCODER
           CONFIG_LIBVPX_VP9_DECODER
           CONFIG_LIBVPX_VP9_ENCODER
           CONFIG_OGG_DEMUXER
           CONFIG_OGG_MUXER
           CONFIG_OPUS_DECODER
           -CONFIG_OPUS_ENCODER
           CONFIG_OPUS_MUXER
           CONFIG_OPUS_PARSER
       "
       FFMPEG_CUSTOM_OPTIONS="
           -libvpx_vp8_decoder
           -libvpx_vp8_encoder
           libvpx_vp9_decoder
           libvpx_vp9_encoder
           opus_decoder
           -opus_encoder
           opus_muxer
           opus_parser
       "

  After you have built your package, it would be a good idea to test it first
  to find missing symbols that may prevent the parent app from functioning.
  This can be done with the `ffmpeg -formats` and the
  `ffmpeg -codecs | grep -E -e "(D\.|\.E|DE)[V][I.][L.][S.] .*"` commands.
  Also test with actual scenario also.

  FFMPEG_CLEAR_CONFIG_SETS - space delimited list to of component types to disable.
  This can be used to find problematic sets of options.  Only valid when
  clear-config-first USE flag is enabled.

  Examples:

    FFMPEG_CLEAR_CONFIG_SETS="decoders demuxers" # Clears decoders or demuxers
    FFMPEG_CLEAR_CONFIG_SETS="bsfs decoders demuxers encoders indevs muxers outdevs" # Default

  Acceptable values:

    bsfs, decoders, demuxers, encoders, indevs, muxers, outdevs

  Notes:

  Adding parsers, protocol, protocols to FFMPEG_CLEAR_CONFIG_SETS will likely
  break.  It is better to remove options individually.

  You can use the corresponding one liners with 3 column entries under
  the "Enabled parsers", "Enabled protocols", "Enabled filters" sections during
  the configure phase dumped to a file t to disable each corresponding set
  individually:

  for x in $(cat t | tr " " "\n" | sort | uniq) ; do echo "-${x}_parser" ; done
  for x in $(cat t | tr " " "\n" | sort | uniq) ; do echo "-${x}_protocol" ; done
  for x in $(cat t | tr " " "\n" | sort | uniq) ; do echo "-${x}_filter" ; done


  FFMPEG_NVCCFLAGS

   You can override the defaults to nvcc flags passed to the nvcc compiler.

   Example:

   FFMPEG_NVCCFLAGS="-gencode arch=compute_60,code=sm_61 -O2"

  Additional notes

   * The pic USE flag may be required for LTO builds.
   * Either Gold LTO or Thin LTO may only be used for LTO.
   * Using BFD LTO may result in linker errors.
   * Replace ~~ with double hyphens.
     XML does not support double hyphens in xml comments in compatibility mode.
