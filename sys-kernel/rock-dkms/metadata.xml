    The rock-dkms package contains the ROCK-Kernel-Driver.
  </longdescription>
  <!--

    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    This package will build the kernel modules using the DKMS framework allowing
    for version agnostic compatibility meaning that you can compile this package 
    against the latest point release of the long-term support kernel 5.4.x
    kernel series only (for security update reasons).  The ROCk
    package has more GPU features like IPC related features (Memory sharing API,
    Signal sharing API); increasing GPU system memory limits from 3/8 of system 
    memory to 29/32 of system memory; RDMA (aka Remote Device Programming or 
    ROCmRDMA) to allow other PCIe kernel modules and devices DMA access to GPU
    memory, KFD (Kernel Fusion Driver) features, and DirectGMA (Direct 
    Graphic Memory Access) support.  ROCk is also a core component of the
    ROCm platform.

    This amdgpu module contains extra kernel parameters compared to the
    vanilla amdgpu module that can be used to tune ROCk, SSG, power savings,
    memory usage.  For details, do `modinfo amdgpu`.


    It must look like:

    ROCK_DKMS_KERNELS_5_7="6.1.53-builder 6.1.^-gaming 6.1.^-pf"

    * 5_7 comes from the package major/minor version for this package.
    ROCK_DKMS_KERNELS_X_Y contains a X the major version and Y the minor
    version.  sys-kernel/rocm-dkms-5.7.0 would correspond to
    ROCK_DKMS_KERNELS_5_7.

    Use:

    * to build all point releases
    Examples: 5.2.*-builder

    ^ to build only the highest point release
    Examples: 5.2.^-builder

      Checks if ACPI support is enabled in the kernel.  Enabling ACPI may
      enhance multigpu detection with PowerXpress (multigpu laptops), provide
      more sysfs info, access to ACPI events for laptops, dynamic PCI-e
      frequency tuning.

    <flag name="rt">
      Applies a PREEMPT_RT patch to prevent a kernel hang.  This requires the a
      kernel with the rt patch already applied to complete the other half of the
      patch.  This requirement currently applies to 5.6.x kernel series or
      earlier.

      Signs the modules if necessary.

    <flag name="ssg">
      Checks kernel config for SSG (Solid State Graphics) support.
    </flag>
    <flag name="strict-pairing">
      Ensures that the equivalent firmware used is the same one as the release
      of this package.  Meaning that the firmware is the same such that for
      example 5.6.0 kernel driver is paired with the 5.6 firmware.  Otherwise,
      the kernel driver is paired with a version greater than or equal to
      the firmware version.

      (Note in recent versions 5.0 or later, the rock-dkms-firmware package has
      not been released separately like in older versions but the
      amdgpu-dkms-firmware matching the rocm version has been used instead.)
