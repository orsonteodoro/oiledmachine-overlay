    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    Performance-oriented Congestion Control (PCC) is a congestion
    control algorithm.  Both PCC Allegro and PCC Vivace are TCP variations
    available as a kernel module, while PCC Proteus is the QUIC version
    and userspace only.

    It combines empiricalism, decision theory, and game theory.
    Empiricalism will do send rate tests to gather observed statistics -
    throughput, latency, etc.

    It feeds the observed data to utility functions (aka Simple Additive
    Weighing [SAW] or Weighted Linear Combo [WLC]).  PCC does send rate changes
    instead of the problematic additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD)
    on the control window (cwmd) used in TCP Tahoe inspired variations, changing
    assumptions.  It penalizes multiple problematic characterisics through a
    utility function and rewards based on rate increase.

    Then, it compares the utility functions score.  These utility functions are
    associated with possible Nash equilibriums.  It selects the corresponding
    send rate with the highest utility score.

    Both variants have low bufferbloat.

    PCC Vivace has a slow start similar to TCP Cubic.  PCC Vivace has low
    consistent RTT, and throughput is very steady with fewest dips.

    Packet loss rate is about 4-11% for ~20 multiple flows and 5% or less at
    ~5 coexisting flows.  PCC has about 5-10% less packet loss than BBR
    according to upstream graphs.

    PCC Allegro is more greedy with multiple flows of different congestion
    control disciplines (e.g. cubic) but less greedy than BBR.

    PCC Vivace is more fair with multiple flows of different congestion control
    disciplines (e.g. cubic) so less throughput.  [Throughput and fairness
    are often tradeoffs.]

    PCC Vivace has lower latency than PCC Allegro.

    It may shave off hours (or an order of magnitude of time) when sending data
    compared to TCP Cubic.

        Algorithm       Mathematical model       Inputs to utility function
         Allegro         SAW with sigmoid        send rate, loss rate
         Vivace      SAW with gradient ascent    send rate, loss rate, RTT [gradient]
        Proteus-P    SAW with gradient ascent    send rate, loss rate, [non-negative] RTT [gradient]
        Proteus-S    SAW with gradient ascent    same as Proteus-P but with added competitive flow congestion [std dev RTT_mi(i) of the ith monitor interval] term
        Proteus-H           multiple             send rate is less than threshold piecewise function to either Proteus-P or -H utility functions
                                                 (The threshold send rate is set by application for reasons such as video streaming.)

    * The send rate doubles per RTT as it moves up the gradient during slow start.
    * the loss rate does depend on packet loss in the source code.
    * RTT gradient is a linear regression of RTT and time of first and last
      packets during monitor interval.

    The improved PCC variant, PCC Proteus is currently not packaged on the
    overlay due to modularity issues.  It is better used as an internal
    dependency.


    Pre-merge configuration

    You must define PCC_KERNELS in /etc/portage/make.conf or as a
    per-package environment variable."

    Examples:

      PCC_KERNELS=\"5.4.^-builder 5.15.^-builder\" # for latest installed point release
      PCC_KERNELS=\"5.4.*-builder 5.15.*-builder\" # for all installed point releases
      PCC_KERNELS=\"5.4.261-builder 5.15.139-builder\" # for exact point releases
      PCC_KERNELS=\"5.4.261-builder 5.15.^-builder 6.1.*-builder\" # for all three cases releases

    This is to allow to support LTS, stable, and live kernels at the same time."
