    Performance-oriented Congestion Control is a TCP Congestion
    control kernel module.

    It uses an AI principles, for example to converge towards the best
    sending rates.

    PCC Vivace has a slow start similar to cubic.  Low consistent RTT.
    Throughput is very steady with fewest dips.

    Both variants have low bufferbloat.

    PCC Vivace has lower latency than PCC Allegro.

    It can shave off hours of time sending data compared to cubic.

  <use>
    <flag name="allegro">
      Uses loss based sigmoid utility function without latency consideration
      [which may contribute to bufferbloat] + heuristic rate control.  Created
      circa 2015.  TCP version.
    </flag>
    <flag name="vivace">
      Uses a latency incorporating concave utility function + gradient
      ascent as rate control.   Created circa 2018.  TCP version.  Safer
      version.
