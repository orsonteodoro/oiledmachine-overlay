    ot-sources is a customizable patchset compilation package that applies
    patches for performance, encryption, and security to the Linux kernel.
  </longdescription>
  <![CDATA[
  <!--

    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    The package prefers to unbundle patchsets, in preference for the
    version of the feature that was released directly from original author,
    but sometimes prefers the bundled repackaged version for the major.minor
    series especially if they are difficult to maintain between major.minor
    series.

    Power users can choose either the BMQ, PDS, MuQSS CPU schedulers.  These
    schedulers focus on normal non-realtime tasks.

    Multi-Gen LRU is a redesign of the current LRU design with
    more complex and accurate separation into multiple lists (aka generations)
    instead of the current LRU design of 2 which may be too coarse and result in
    inefficient reclamation.  The recommended tunings address mobile, cloud,
    desktop usage and should be customized or considered if not desktop which
    may differ from the defaults.

    The TRESOR patch provides increased mitigation from cold boot resistant
    attacks.  TRESOR is vulnerable to a DMA attack side-channel attack.  All
    older hardware that does not have IOMMU VT-d / Vi and not using it is
    vulnerable.  DMA attack is used to extract keys.  See

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOMMU-supporting_hardware

    for a list of hardware supporting IOMMU.

    Compiler based optimizations are provided by GraySky2's
    kernel_compiler_patch.  If you would like to apply this patch, simply add
    -march=native or -march=SUBARCH or -mcpu=SUBARCH.  If using cross-compiling
    or distcc, do not use the native option but the microarchitecture kernel
    config option instead.

    The O3 patch allows for O3 compiler optimiation is provided by the
    zen kernel.  Using it requires adding CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -O3"
    equivalent to per-package USE flags.

    Older point releases are removed to eliminate some of the previously
    announced 0-day exploits.

    4.14.x kernel series is kept around for vanilla TRESOR.
    TRESOR for 5.x is experimental.  Only CBC mode is only recommended
    and should only be used.

    Using TRESOR with fscrypt is currently not supported.  The ebuild
    developer is currently working towards that goal.  Changing the key
    in the middle of writing may result in data loss, meaning half the
    data may be encrypted with two different keys.  The fscrypt version
    with TRESOR support will address this problem.

    Only Long Term Support (LTS) kernel and those marked stable
    in kernel.org are kept.  However, feature patchsets typically do not
    backport updates, so the latest stable should be used if you want updates
    or bugfixes for patchsets.  For reliable working builds, use the
    LTS series.

    6.17 (Live)						A
    Ebuild support for live is temporarily down but may change in the future.


    [1] Kernel LTS provides security updates and bugfixes, but doesn't extend to
        third party patchsets
    [2] Third party patchset LTS has provided updates
    [3] only from the oiledmachine-overlay repo
    [4] without correctness verification, due to lack of hardware or
        configuration.  Correctness and build fixes extends only to device
        agnostic independent code.
    [5] backported or forwardported, but not intended for this series, but build
        time fixes are provided by the ebuild maintainer
    [6] backported or forwardported, but not intended for this series, but build
        time fixes are provided by others if it is a recent new kernel
        series.

    A - Currently actively updatable
    R - Released only for major.minor usually no futher updates for patch versions
    D - USE flag should be disabled since there is no release for this minor
        version yet.
    N - Under the Patchset LTS indicates that the patchset is EOL or likely
        EOL for that version which means that bug fixes and security updates
        will not be provided.  This indicates a feature freeze, but
        build time failures will be fixed by the ebuild maintainer.
    E - No upstream release for this major minor version but fully maintained or
        supported by the ebuild maintainer or third party.  It means the same as
        third party Yes supported.
    I - Inactive due to changing API, but future support depends on motivation
    S - Upstream indicated support
    T - Patch is undergoing testing
    b - Build tested but without correctness verification due to lack of hardware
    X - Patch provided by alternative or multiple independent forks.
    Y - Patch is LTS supported upstream.
    ? - Unknown status

    EOL (End Of Life) stable kernels get dropped next update cycle which is
    typically a week.  The virtual/ot-sources-stable ebuild-package
    should handle the transition gracefully.

    Use virtual/ot-sources-lts or virtual/ot-sources-stable to track and
    update releases instead of emerging sys-kernel/ot-sources directly.
    It's recommended to use the ot-sources-lts if you have binary only kernel
    modules.  For those without binary only modules, use ot-sources-stable
    package.



    Design choices and walk-through of the configuration user interfaces for ebuild

    1. Menuconfig - This is primarily available to enable/disable drivers or for
    users that prefer a menuconfig only experience.   Menuconfig allows for
    editing kernel settings with buttons and windows.  The menuconfig is still
    the preferred way to decrapify the kernel config versus automated means.
    2. Environment variables (aka envars) - This is a collection of tweakables
    that can be used to modify the default kernel config or an existing kernel
    config.  It is mostly useful in assist mode.  Most envars will be ignored in
    non-assist mode.  It will override menuconfig edited kernel config settings
    in some cases.
    3. USE flags - This is primarily to install dependencies or download
    patches.
    4. OT_KERNEL_USE - This is primarily to apply patches per extraversion
    profile.  It is only useful in assist mode.
    5. env file - Used to store the per extraversion environment variables.
    These env files are typically stored in
    /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${EXTRAVERSION}/${ARCH}/env
    The /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${EXTRAVERSION}/${ARCH}/ folder
    can be used to store assets like logos.
    6. kernel config file - A file that stores the kernel config.  These are
    typically stored in the /etc/kernels/ folder.



    CFLAGS and HOSTCFLAGS

    CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS are applied to the kernel CHOST or target machine.

    HOSTCFLAGS, HOSTCXXFLAGS, HOSTLDFLAGS are applied to CBUILD programs.

    If HOSTCFLAGS is not set, it uses CFLAGS.  Same is true with the other
    pairs.

    The above CFLAGS should be added to the per build profile.  If not added,
    it will use the *FLAGS provided by /etc/portage/make.conf.

    Currently X86_MICROARCH_OVERRIDE will override the -march or -mcpu for
    CFLAGS.  Consideration for simplification of -march and
    X86_MICROARCH_OVERRIDE is open at this time with likely the removal of the
    latter envvar.  So both should be set at this time to the same
    -march/-mcpu to avoid confusion.



    Using the build USE flag (without PGO)

    The build USE flag can be used to build the kernel.  It comes with extra
    environment variables that can be placed in the per extraversion env file.

    The build USE flag was necessary to increase the security of the -rt patchset
    with a more customized limited config.

    It also speeds up deployment time to decrease the security update lag.

    The following steps need to be taken:

      0. Mount the boot partition
      1. Emerge with the build USE flag
      2. Run etc-update
      3. Build and install initramfses per each built kernel
      4. Update the bootloader
      5. Reboot


    Signed kernel modules corresponding to a build and that build's private key
    require multiple runs of "genkernel ... initramfs".  This means that N build
    profiles each having a unique private key required N kernel initramfs
    invocations.  If you built 5 profiles you need 5 corresponding
    initramfs updates.


    The PDO/PGO (Profile Directed Optimization / Profile Guided Optimization) progression:

    1. start from unknown state
    2. PGI = Build as instrumented
    3. PGT = Train with actual typical use, or simulation script that replays or mimics typical use, or benchmarks
    4. PGO = Build as optimized
    5. end

    Notes:

      * The FORCE_PGO_PHASE environment variable may be used to unbreak or disable PGO.
      * PGI, PGT, PGO, PG0 are valid values.  PG0 means to disable/skip PGO.
      * PDI, PDT, PDO, PD0 are deprecated and will be removed in the next minor version.
      * The ot-kernel.eclass contains a picture diagram of the state diagram.
      * A verification of major.minor version is needed for profile compatibility.
      * Restarting the process be required if the compiler's major and minor version is different.
      * It is not recommeded to update or change the compiler to the middle during the PGO process.

    Using the build USE flag with the pgo USE flag

    The following steps need to be taken:

      0. Mount the boot partition
      1. Emerge with the build and pgo USE flags
      2. Run etc-update
      3. Build and install initramfs
      4. Update the bootloader
      5. Reboot
      6. mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
         (For GCC PGO if /sys/kernel/debug is not mounted yet by init scripts)
      7. Train the kernel with the pgo-trainer.sh script or your own simulation
         script
      8. Re-emerge the package with the build and pgo USE flag for an optimized
         build



    Resetting PGO

    The PGO progression state can be reset by deleting the
    /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV} folder or the .pgophase file.



    PGO state files and profiles:

    /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV}/${extraversion}-${arch}/{llvm,gcc}/pgophase -
      The PGO phase progression state file that contains the current step.
      {PGI,PGT,PGO,DONE} are the states in the FSM (Finite State Machine).
    /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV}/${extraversion}-${arch}/llvm/vmlinux.profraw -
      The profraw captured before conversion.
    /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV}/${extraversion}-${arch}/llvm/vmlinux.profdata -
      The merged profdata PGO profile.  It is used when building an optimized
      build.
    /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV}/${extraversion}-${arch}/gcc/#var#tmp#portage#sys-kernel#ot-sources-${PV}#work#linux-${PV}-${extraversion}#sound#usb#clock.gcda -
      The GCC PGO profile.  It is used when building an optimized build.

    Notes:
    - The .profdata may be used between major versions.
    - The .profraw may sometimes used between minor versions.
    - The .gcda is common among PGO packages, but .gcno is of unknown use.
    - The generated .gcda above is just a sample path.  It may vary per
      configuration.

    Important:  If a change to the PGO patch has been made, the
    /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV} folder and the files in it should be manually
    removed to restart the PGO process.


    LLVM versions supported for Clang PGO:

    * 18.x
    * 17.x
    * 16.x
    * 15.x
    * 14.x
    * 13.0.1
    * 13.0.0 

    Versions that are not *exactly* the ones listed above are not supported.
    The PGO profraw format used is sensitive to point version changes and even
    in the live ebuilds, and it's the reason why exact versions are only
    supported up and including profraw version 8.



    Using pgo-trainer.sh, aka the automated PGO trainer script

    It becomes tedious or too repetitive to manually train the kernel.
    This is why an automated trainer script pgo-trainer.sh (also found in the modded
    genkernel) is provided to automatically train the kernel.  You can of course
    write your own automated script.  The script can be extended with
    pgo_custom.sh in the same directory or modded directly.  Using pgo_custom.sh
    is recommended to preserve changes between installs.  It should be ran only
    as a non-root user.  This script is compatible with PDO.

    * CFG means Control Flow Graph.  Essentially if/else and function calls will
      be profiled.  It may profile calls that act like constructors and
      deconstructors, conditional loops.

    PGO/PDO for kernel mini FAQ

    - Q:  Does GCC PGO work now for the kernel?
      A:  Yes and no, but not for Full PGO.  Some people consider PDO and CFG
          only PGO as PGO because it uses a profile and multiple step workflow,
          but it may likely miss the benefits or the expected optimizations that
          are missing in authentic and widely used Full PGO.

          For Full PGO, it breaks during the building of the PGO image.  The
          patch can be found at http://coolypf.com/kpgo.htm.  Most of the heavy
          lifting I would guess is already been done by that patch but it really
          needs a update for the newer GCCs and it is behind like 8 major
          versions from 4.9.  The only remaining item left is the missing -Os
          changes mentioned in the Yuan-ScienceChina-18 document which
          can be found at

            https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel/Optimization#GCC_PGO

          The following points still have missing implementation for complete
          support for Full PGO with GCC:
          * sections 3.2 - value profiling which corresponds to in the
            kernel's kernel/gcov/gcc_base.c and
            __gcov_*_profiler symbols in libgcov-profiler.c or specifically
              __gcov_indirect_call (GCC 9.1.0, GPL-3+, gcc-runtime-library-exception-3.1)
              __gcov_indirect_call_profiler_v4 (GCC 10.1.0, GPL-3+, gcc-runtime-library-exception-3.1)
              __gcov_indirect_call_topn_profiler (GCC 5.1.0, GPL-3+, gcc-runtime-library-exception-3.1)
              __gcov_time_profiler (GCC 4.9.0, GPL-3+ gcc-runtime-library-exception-3.1)
              __gcov_time_profiler_counter (GCC 7.1.0, GPL-3+, gcc-runtime-library-exception-3.1)
          * section 3.4 bullet point 2 changes to fix -Os in GCC
          * section 3.6 lists overall requirements
          * The patch is on hold indefinitely until license incompatibilities
            are resolved or workarounds provided to avoid license incompatible
            symbols.  It may require edits to the sys-devel/gcc-kpgo ebuild to
            avoid/disable these symbols and to use the older license compatible
            PGO profile format.
    - Q:  Does Clang PGO work?
      A:  No outstanding perceptable differences before and after, but it does do
          all steps without problems.
    - Q:  Why do I keep seeing warning: '....gcda' profile count data file not
          found [-Wmissing-profile]?
      A:  It could be either one of these:
          * The compiler is hinting that you skipped training for that.  If
            it is not of value, don't train it.
          * Name mangling bug.  This was observed with paths that have /../ that
            should be mangled as #^# but this information is lost in
            /sys/kernel/debug/gcov to fix it.  This serious issue pertains also
            to the amdgcn driver.
    - Q:  What does PGO do?
      A:  It depends on the implementation.
          For optimized builds it may do the following:
          - Automatic hot or cold classification, instead of manual annotations.
          - Hot code may get essentially -O3 treatment.
          - Cold code may get essentially -Os treatment.
          - Coalesces code into either hot or cold sections or maybe pages.
          - Code reordering or improving locality
          - Loop rolling or unrolling loops based on PGO profile and thresholds.
    - Q:  What is the performance?
      A:  Avg: 10% to -0.5% benefit.  Potentially 40% outliers.
    - Q:  What benefits the greatest from PGO?
      A:  Throughput, TPS (Transactions Per Second), Requests Per Second, server
          related parts on the kernel side
    - Q:  How do I avoid the worst case performance?
      A:  Do not do comprehesive training.  Train only actively used drivers,
          subsystems, algorithms, user space programs.  The goal again is to
          optimize the cache heirarchy not pollute it with least likely used
          pages or not increasing the number page faults.
    - Q:  Which is better active or passive training?
      A:  It depends...  For the least time investment, use passive traning.
          For consistent performance determinism try writing your own custom
          active training script.
    - Q:  When should I do PGO?
      A:  It should be done at the beginning of the release cycle.  Doing
          it about a week after the release may result in imminent replacement.
          Do not train more than once in a point release.
    - Q:  Should I pick GCC PGO or Clang PGO?
      A:  It depends if you plan to use KCFI or other compiler features.
          GCC PGO looks promising with the least amount of time investment.

          If fully implemented, GCC_PGO should have more profilers or
          instrumented kinds of data versus CLANG_PGO.  So far, CLANG_PGO has
          more kinds of profiled data.  The more implemented profilers, the
          more access to other types of 19 types of optimizations in
          -fprofile-use.
    - Q:  Does it really feel slow running under a instrumented kernel?
      A:  No outstanding noticeable difference.
    - Q:  How do I unstuck myself from broken PGO and compile without it?
      A:  Try one these:
          - Disable the pgo USE flag.
          - FORCE_PGO_PHASE="PG0" emerge =ot-sources-${PV}
          - Delete the /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV} or the
            /var/lib/ot-sources/${PV}/${extraversion}-${arch} folder.
    - Q:  Difference between PGO and PDO?
      A:  PDO is a weaker optimization compared to PGO.  PDO can only do
          optimization based on the CFG (Control Flow Graph) not values. 
          PGO is more difficult to apply on the kernel, but with PDO it
          is more easier.  Kernel GCOV support for PGO is not fully implemented,
          but requires patches.
    - Q:  Do I need use the same version before and after?
      A:  Yes likely depending if the profile was not converted to a version
          agnostic format.
    - Q:  Is it easy to PGO?
      A:  Yes, the ebuild tries its best to simplify.  It requires 2 emerges and
          training in the middle.



    The config file-directory structure

    The tree structure is as follows in abstract form:

      /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${extraversion}/${arch}/env
      /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${extraversion}/${arch}/patches

    KV_MAJOR_MINOR will be expanded to either 4.14, 5.4, 5.10, 5.15, 6.1.

    extraversion will be expanded to ot, rt, or a custom name.

    arch will expand to one of the folder names in the arches folder in
    /usr/src/linux/arch.

    Example:

      /etc/portage/ot-sources/5.16/ot/x86_64/env

    Files:

      /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${extraversion}/${arch}/env
      Contains all environment variables for this buildconfig.  The
      per package extraversion and per package buildconfig are synonymous
      for this file.

    Directories (In planning):

      /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${extraversion}/${arch}/patches
      Contains extra user patches to apply per buildconfig.

    Commentary about the above settings:

    The example builder profile above assumes stability and minimal downtime.

    The gaming profile above is similar to my gaming experience and principles
    in the mid to late 2000s.  Stability is the most important.  Frames Per
    Second (FPS) is as equally important as input latency.  Both are more
    important than security.

    The USE flag controls downloading and the OT_KERNEL_USE controls applying
    the patch per profile.

    Slub is used for high memory use which is typical for compiling.  Slab
    is preferred for caching and runtime performance.

    The CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS should be set per profile to properly
    control the stability and performance.  If they are not set, they will use
    the systemwide values.  Upstream has a negative attitude for -O3 and
    criticize the code quality.

    To generate the kernel config, you may set OT_KERNEL_MENUCONFIG_UI to
    menuconfig then emerge, then change it back to disabled then emerge.
    The menuconfig can be used to enable drivers.

    Commentary:

    The gaming profile assumes ideal conditions in secure environment (i.e.
    behind firewall, gaming app only, no clicking on phishing emails, no hacker
    probes or attacks adjacent or over the network, no browsing over the
    internet).  It is time limited during the duration of gameplay.

    The musican profile would be similar to the gaming profile but without swap.
    It would use the digital-audio-workstation work profile instead.

    Browsing over the Internet is done over the builder profile or the secure
    profile.

    The builder profile is designed for installing and building ebuilds.
    Variations of the builder profile are often tested compared to gaming
    and secure env profiles.  With pre-KFENCE changes, uptime was 60 days.  The
    builder profile is similar to the default vanilla kernel but only changes
    to IO scheduler and TCP congestion control and slight adjustment to HZ
    to improve compilation throughput.  The reason why it is similar is
    that in the past I was trying to fix the stability and uptime problem.
    The result is a crashless experience in the 60 days and less
    fiddling with the tunables which translates to a better satisfying
    experience.  The builder profile can be considered a general purpose
    production ready primary profile if you cannot decide what settings to
    choose.

    The secure profile is designed for paying bills, private information.

    The gentoo-sources profile does not mitigate with KCFI against JOP/ROP
    in pre CET era, which can lead to code execution attacks.  It is missing
    KCFI and SCS.  However, a custom profile enabling KCFI or SCS can mitigate
    against JOP/ROP attacks.

    The profiles on ot-kernel will be improved over time.



    Environment variables overview:

    The purpose of some of these environment variables is to change primarily
    the default profile a little bit so that it skips the menuconfig step all
    together in the build before install with the build USE flag.  1 means yes.
    0 means no.  Auto assumes native build.  Due to the possibly of dependent
    options, 0 may also mean custom or previous settings.



    The difference between USE flags versus OT_KERNEL_USE:

    The USE flags control *downloading* patches, logos, ebuilds.   However, the
    OT_KERNEL_USE is intended to *applying* patches or settings per each
    extraversion profile.  The USE flags will be used as a fallback if
    OT_KERNEL_USE is not utilized.  The other motivation for having
    OT_KERNEL_USE was to reduce the attack surface by disabling poor quality
    patches or disabling patches from untrusted sources for secure kernel
    configurations.

    Environment variables:

    DISABLE_DEBUG_EXCLUDES - A space delimited list of kernel config symbols
    to ignore.



    OT_KERNEL_5_LEVEL_PAGING - set 5 level paging for supercomputers

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, auto, unset

    Unset implies manual setting or previous setting.



    OT_KERNEL_ABIS - Adds support for ABIS especially cross compiling but only
    if the kernel arch supports it.  You many only choose one kernel arch per
    buildconfig env.  If unset, it will use auto settings.  Users are still
    responsible for editing the kernel config for details such as the
    microarchiecture, integrated circuits (ICs), or details relating to ABI.
    For endianess, you must set the CHOST variable in the per build env
    file.  (EXPERIMENTAL)

    Acceptable values:

      auto					; Autodetect and auto-enable ABIs
      manual					; Previous settings
      arm					; For the arm

    OT_KERNEL_AUTOSUSPEND_SECONDS_AUDIO - Set the number of seconds to delay into
    power save mode.  It is suggested that 10 is a good value and the ebuild default
    for on-demand or green power saving scenarios.  Upstream defaults it to 0
    meaning always on.

    OT_KERNEL_ADD_KEY_TO_MOK - Auto adds the provided key to MOK if not found.



    OT_KERNEL_ARCH - The native ABI of the kernel to build using one of the
    names of the folders in /usr/src/linux/arch.  This package assumes that both
    x86_64 and arm64 are recognized as 64 with possibly 32 compatibility, but
    x86 and arm are recognized as strictly 32-bit.
    Both the folder path (${arch} in
    /etc/portage/ot-sources/${KV_MAJOR_MINOR}/${extraversion}/${arch}/env) and
    the OT_KERNEL_ARCH need to be the same.

    More arches are supported by the kernel but not supported by the distro.
    See https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/gentoo/tree/stable/profiles/arch

    Acceptable values:

      alpha, arm, arm64, loongarch, m68k, mips, parisc, parisc64, powerpc,
      riscv, s390, sparc, sparc32, sparc64, x86, x86_64



    OT_KERNEL_AUTO_CONFIGURE_KERNEL_FOR_PKGS - Auto edit the kernel .config
    for installed packages.  What this means is that certain @world packages
    have additional kernel .config requirements and sometimes too complex
    or too long ago to remember to apply.  These missing or conflicting
    flags will be added or removed so that the @world package works properly.

    Acceptable values:

      1 to enable, 0 to disable

    By default, it is disabled meaning that manual editing is required or
    preferred.  For some select security packages, this is environment variable
    is unconditionally ignored implying to always apply the kernel changes.



    OT_KERNEL_BLACKLIST_FIRMWARE_PATHS - A space separated list of firmware
    relative paths to not include in CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE.



    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS - Set and embed the kernel command line into the
    kernel instead of the bootloader.

    Notes

      If lockdown is not enabled, it will use the appended values from the
      bootloader.

      You may remove delayacct from the kernel command line if you decide not to
      keep iotop.

      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS_LOCKDOWN



    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS_LOCKDOWN - Prevent bootloader from overriding
    the internal kernel cmdline.

    Certain security options may auto enable this if they happen to use
    the kernel command line.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - enable
      0 - disable
      unset - manual settings

    See also

      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS



    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_DECOMPRESSOR - chooses the main boot decompressor for both
    kernel decompression and initramfs decompression.  If not chosen, it will
    choose either the previous manual setting, or if it is a new kernel config
    defaults which will choose gzip for the kernel and all decompressors for
    initramfs.

    Acceptable values:

      GZIP, BZIP2, LZ4, LZO, LZMA, XZ, ZSTD, default, manual, UNCOMPRESSED

    It is recommended to use lz4 or zstd.  However, if you are
    using x32 ABI bzip2 works but do not use lzma.  If empty, it will choose
    manual.  ZSTD is only allowed in 5.10+.



    OT_KERNEL_BUILD - It be 0, 1, true, false, yes, no, nobuild, build, not
    set.  Most are aliases, but it means to build or not build the kernel.  If
    not set it will try to guestimate based on the build flag.

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_BUILD_CHECK_MOUNTED
      OT_KERNEL_KERNEL_DIR



    OT_KERNEL_BUILD_CHECK_MOUNTED - Check if the boot directory referenced
    by OT_KERNEL_KERNEL_DIR is mounted.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - check
      0 - don't check
      unset - check

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_KERNEL_DIR



    OT_KERNEL_BUILD_ALL_MODULES_AS - Choose how to build options capable of
    being built as modules.  You can choose to convert kernel config
    options as mostly modules (m) or all builtins (y).  One may choose to
    build everything as builtins to prevent loading of hacked drivers or to
    speed up init time.  One may also choose mostly modules to load drivers
    on demand.  This option depends on OT_KERNEL_MODULES_SUPPORT=y.
    (EXPERIMENTAL, TESTING)

    Acceptable values:

      m, y, manual

    Unset is equivalent to manual.

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_KOPTIONS_APPEND
      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_SUBSYSTEMS
      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_SUBSYSTEMS_APPEND
      OT_KERNEL_MODULES_SUPPORT



    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_KOPTIONS - A space separated list of CONFIG_... options to
    be built as builtins instead as modules.  This setting is optional.  This
    option depends on OT_KERNEL_BUILD_ALL_MODULES_AS="m".  This option focuses
    on specific devices.  This information can be found in help "defined at"
    section in "make menuconfig".

    Example:

    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_SUBSYSTEMS - A space separated list of subsystems required
    to boot as builtins instead of modules used to replace the defaults.
    This information can be found in the help "defined at"
    section in in "make menuconfig".  Early KMS requires drivers/char/agp,
    drivers/gpu, and drivers/video to be added.

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_SUBSYSTEMS="drivers/input/keyboard drivers/hid drivers/ata fs drivers/scsi drivers/block"

    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_SUBSYSTEMS_APPEND - An additional space separated list of
    subsystems required to boot as builtins appended to the default set of boot
    required subsystems.  Early KMS requires drivers/char/agp
    and drivers/gpu to be added.

    microcode is up-to-date for mitigation against criticial vulnerabilies.
    This check is only available during kernel config assist mode.

    Acceptable values:

      0 for disable checking
      1 for enable checking (default)

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_CPU_MICROCODE
      OT_KERNEL_FIRMWARE



    OT_KERNEL_CLEAR_LINUX_PATCHSET_BLACKLIST - a space separated list of
    patches to skip.  These are just basenames.

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_CLEAR_LINUX_PATCHSET_BLACKLIST="0109-initialize-ata-before-graphics.patch"



    OT_KERNEL_CLEAR_LINUX_PATCHSET_EXTRA - a space separated list of patches to
    apply that didn't get applied unconditionally.  Any patch that doesn't have
    Patch[0-9]+: in front of it in linux.spec are candidates for inclusion.
    They get applied from left to right order.

    See https://github.com/clearlinux-pkgs/linux for details.

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_CLEAR_LINUX_PATCHSET_EXTRA="sched-hybrid1.patch sched-hybrid2.patch sched-hybrid3.patch sched-hybrid4.patch"



    OT_KERNEL_COLD_BOOT_MITIGATIONS - changes the kernel config to mitigate
    against cold boot attacks.

    Acceptable values:

      0 for do not apply any mitigations
      1 for applying mitigations

    See also

      OT_KERNEL_DMA_ATTACK_MITIGATIONS
      OT_KERNEL_IMA



    OT_KERNEL_CONFIG - Points to the absolute path of the kernel config. (This
    can be not set but then defaults to
    /etc/kernels/kernel-config-${PV}-${extraversion}-$(uname -m))

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG



    OT_KERNEL_CONFIG_MODE - Choose between ebuild assisted and fully custom
    config.

    Acceptable values:

      assist - allow the ebuild to auto configure the config. (default)
      custom - have full control over the config.

    Notes:

      - In custom mode:
        * No kernel config validation will be done.
        * All or most of the environment variables will not have any affect.
        * The OT_KERNEL_BUILD is still available.
        * The OT_KERNEL_MENUCONFIG* environment variables are available.
        * The OT_KERNEL_USE is still valid in src_prepare() for per-profile
          patching.



    OT_KERNEL_CPU_SCHED - can be one of the below depending on the kernel version.

      4.14: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, muqss, muqss-latency, muqss-throughput, pds
      5.10: cfs, cfs-throghhput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, muqss, muqss-latency, muqss-throughput, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds
      5.15: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, nest, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds
      6.1: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, nest, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds
      6.6: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, nest, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds
      6.12: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds
      6.13: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds
      6.14: cfs, cfs-throughput, cfs-interactive, cfs-autogroup, prjc, prjc-bmq, prjc-pds

      The reason why for this flexibility is to allow for multiple
      configurations that are not mutual exclusive, meaning you can use the rt
      patchset with CFS but still choose MuQSS for a gaming client kernel.

      This field can be not set which would default to using cfs.

      Notes:

        - cfs is preferred for server kernels and bug-less experience.
        - cfs by default disables autogroup or uses previous settings
        - cfs-interactive is an alias for cfs-autogroup
        - autogroup will be disabled in all other schedulers.
        - muqss and pds-mq are better suited for audio production for the
          ISO priority class.
        - The rt USE/OT_KERNEL_USE flag can only use the cfs scheduler.
        - Anagolus to driving with manual and automatic gears, using autogroup or
          bmq can interfere with controlling individual task placement.
        - For better manual control of individual task placement use either cfs,
          cfs-throughput, muqss, or pds or the sysfs to adjust the weights
          of autogroup.
        - BMQ has been renamed to Project C.  Project C merged both PDS and
          BMQ allowing to choose either scheduler.  C means cross.
        - Project C's version of PDS is not the same as PDS-mq.
	- prjc is the same as prjc-bmq.
        - muqss-latency configures the runqueue for low latency.
        - muqss-latency and muqss-throughput only apply as a fallback for
          work profiles not matching or custom/manual work profiles.
        - Nest 6.7 has 2 releases of the same patch, with and without
          spinning.  By default, the old behavior is used.  To access the
          experimental new behavior without spinning set NEST_SPINNING=0.
          Spinning is a technique used to keep used previously idle cores warm
          or running at higher frequency.  Nest likely only benefits in certain
          configurations.

      The following is discussed in great detail because it affects use of
      scheduling apps that only discuss or assume CFS.  These small details
      relate to security and performance.

      The default timeslices:

        BMQ: 4 ms server/desktop, 2 ms with low latency desktop
        CFS: variable length
        MuQSS:  6 ms
        PDS: 6 ms
        Project C (BMQ/PDS): 4 ms
        Zen MuQSS: 4 ms with zen interactive, 6 ms without zen interactive

        Some of these timeslice values may be adjustable.

      Summary of scheduling policies/classes

        y - supported
        n - not supported

        *1 - Same as NORMAL.  cfs treats BATCH as potentially unpreemptable, but
             BMQ/PDS breaks this assumption.
        *2 - BMQ/PDS uses a single queue
        *3 - It is pseudo RT_RR with iso budget but demoted to NORMAL when budget
             exausted.
             It is unpremptable by NORMAL meaning it will not skip processing
             during it's time window.
             The budget is a percent of all CPUs over 5 seconds.
             It can be used by non-root users.
             It has it's own iso tick timer.
             The original will use 75% of all CPUs but zen-MuQSS will use 25% when
             zen-interactive is enabled.
        *4 - Using the same skiplist
        *5 - Uses RT_RR in self-test.
        *6 - Uses RT_RR in self-test, translates into RT_FIFO during __set_setscheduler.
             However, the queue is not dedicated but shared.

      (Applies to both worst case and amortized summaries)

        [*1]For single task in RT_RR or RT_FIFO, it is O(1)
        [*2]k levels with max 8 which is simply O(1).  The original design of
          the skiplist is O(log n) for insertions but has been changed in this
          implementation
        [*3]O(1) for normal, O(n) for RT_RR or RT_FIFO.
        [*4]The next task to execute is always the head but for RT it usually
            has to scan the the array in some implementations.
        [*5]The O(1) is amortized.

        In layman terms, O(1) is faster than O(log n).  O(log n) is faster than
        O(n).

        (*4) Interactivity under heavy load or just plain desktop use.
        (*5) Usually more smoother under heavy resource use but likely requires
          restart.  It is unknown if this issue is outside of this scheduler
          or the scheduler itself.
        (*6) SCHED_ISO may be abused.  No use caps or timeout cooldown observed.
        (*7) Autogroup cpu burner protections and core scheduling mitigations
          allowed.
        (*8) May increase trashing in older version.  (Memory leak?, related to *18)
        (*9) No CI and no fuzz history.  Precaution should be taken when using
          this under secure scenarios.
        (*10) The nice formulas and virtual deadlines show consistency in SYNC
          with Hz, RTT, etc, but also indicate a weakness in catching up with
          newer hardware.  This means that the formula needs an updated.   All

          some work but all were angry at the production rate.
        (*13) Some users may feel great that work was delivered faster than
          the if rendered alone, but some may feel disapointed due to the
          poor production rate.  Because that resource was freed up faster
          than usual, the other too felt it was faster.
        (*14) Assumes more than enough hardware resources but source code
          and design indicated effort in addressing this scenario.
        (*15) Provides many tunables for tuning for throughput or latency on
          different MC/SMP/NMA configurations, bad on SMT/HT security
          update or lacks review on risk assessment with SMT side-channels
          or compatibility review of core scheduling.
        (*16) May have latency issues in some configurations.
        (*17) Disables core scheduling which disables some/all mitigation against
          SMT side-channel attacks (by flawed processor design).
          SCHED_CORE was available since 5.14.  An alternative is to
          disable HT or replace with new processor design.
        (*18) Usually slower or unstable when forward-ported to later point
          releases.

    OT_KERNEL_CPU_MICROCODE - Auto includes CPU firmware to fix CPU bugs
    and mitigate against some security vulnerabilities.

    There is a risk when updating CPU microcode.  Some well known sites and
    distros have measured or reported performance penalties [in some cases
    single digit frames per second loss] with past microcode updates.

    This option depends on OT_KERNEL_AUTO_CONFIGURE_KERNEL_FOR_PKGS=1.
    The firmware or microcode packages must be installed first.

    Valid values:
      0 (default), 1, path, unset
      1 - auto adds CPU microcode based on /proc/cpuinfo
      path - auto adds CPU microcode based on path to a /proc/cpuinfo snapshot
      Unset is the same as 0 which means manual settings.

    Examples:
      OT_KERNEL_CPU_MICROCODE="1"
      OT_KERNEL_CPU_MICROCODE="/etc/portage/ot-sources/5.15/ot/x86_64/cpu_info"

    OT_KERNEL_DISABLE - Disable processing this extraversion or profile.

    Acceptable values:

      0 - Do not disable this extraversion.
      1 - Disable this extraversion.
      unset - Do not disable this extraversion.



    OT_KERNEL_DMA_ATTACK_MITIGATIONS - changes the kernel config to mitigate
    against DMA attacks.  By default, this is enabled in the ebuild.

    Acceptable values:

      0 for do not apply any mitigations
      1 for level 1 mitigations
      1.5 for level 1.5 mitigations
      2 for level 2 mitigations

    - Level 1 mitigations are changes balance the convenience and the security.
    - Level 1.5 mitigations are changes increase mitigation without disabling
      of use of hardware with additional performance penalty.
    - Level 2 mitigations are changes that severely place security over
      convenience which may take away ability to use certain hardware or have
      severe performance degration.

      0 - Turn off

      debug - Increase logging sizes and log level for debug analysis
      unset - Unset will use manual or previous settings.

    The ebuild will override the user choice in order for certain features to
    work properly.  The following are overrides with top most overrides
    higher priority.

    For the PGI (profile guided instrumentation) step, it is default
      temporarily.
    For enabled OT_KERNEL_COLD_BOOT_MITIGATIONS, it is disabled.
    For userland Clang CFI development, it is recommended to use default temporarily
      if performing tests for segfault detection, but disable it ASAP.



    OT_KERNEL_DRIVER_BUNDLE - Enables a set of preselected driver bundles for
    quick installs.

    Making choices has tradeoffs that involve convenience, storage space, and
    build time when choosing the correct driver bundle.

    Sometimes there is a risk in damaging the device to obtain more precise
    details about the device.  The more general options are provided to reduce
    damage at the cost of more build time.

    You can define a custom hook function
    ot-kernel-driver-bundle_add_custom_driver_bundle in your env profile which
    will add your personal set of drivers.

    Currently ARCH=x86 and ARCH=amd64 are only supported for prelected bundles.

    Acceptable values (tentative):

      early-1990s-pc-gamer
      late-1990s-pc-gamer
      late-1990s-musician
      1990s-cgi-artist

      2020s-pc-gamer
 
      For graphics chips, currently non-oem gaming grade and office grade
      graphics are provided for the driver bundles.  This selection
      process is used to debloat the production build and speed up the
      build process.  The following driver names, generations, or models
      can be choosen.  The first item in the group is the driver name.
      The remaining rows in the group are aliases.

    OT_KERNEL_EARLY_KMS - enable early KMS for graphics improvement.
    This setting fixes early kms problem with OT_KERNEL_BOOT_SUBSYSTEMS="m".
    For out-of-tree Direct Rendering Manager DKMS graphics drivers, this should
    be 0 to load these drivers as modules.

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, y, n, unset

    Unset is equivalent to 1.



    OT_KERNEL_EXTRAVERSION - initials or name of the kernel.

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_PRIMARY_EXTRAVERSION
      OT_KERNEL_PRIMARY_EXTRAVERSION_WITH_TRESOR



    OT_KERNEL_EXTERNAL_MODULES - prepares the kernel for out-of-tree
    modules.  The kernel needs to expose these for packages that build
    kernel drivers outside this package.

    This implies that the source code will be installed in order to build
    external modules.

    Acceptable values:

      1, unset.  Unset means auto detect.



    OT_KERNEL_FAST_SOURCE_CODE_INSTALL - install the kernel sources in the
    fastest way without permissions sanitization.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - fast install without permissions or ownership sanitization.
      0 - slow install with permissions or ownership sanitization.
      unset - slow install with permissions or ownership sanitization.  (default)

    Notes:

      - fast install takes at most a few seconds performing a move into
        image.
      - slow install may take tens of minutes to hours performing copy and
        permissions reset passes into image.

    Requires:

      OT_KERNEL_INSTALL_SOURCE_CODE=1



    OT_KERNEL_FIRMWARE - a space separated list of keywords matching the
    firmware relative to inside /lib/firmware.  Wildcards (denoted by "*") are
    accepted as well as relative paths.  Wildcards are implied before and after
    the pattern.  These patterns are case sensitive meaning there is a
    difference between model and MODEL.  There is a possibility of driver
    writers adding and removing files without notice which is why simple
    keyword matching containing the model name and number without adding
    specific ICs details is recommended.  Keeping this value not set is the
    same as manually editing or reusing the previous value in the .config
    file.  Using this environment variable has advantages of auto adding
    and auto removing firmware references.

    The X in the environment variable name corresponds to the kernel *arch*
    in buildconfigs that is uppercase.  The kernel arch is not exactly the
    same as the distro arch.

    The Y in the environment variable name corresponds to the extraversion
    in buildconfigs that is uppercase.  Both the X and Y values make it
    possible to not apply firmware to virtual machine guest kernels or for
    specific to cross compile kernels.  Any hyphen (-) should be replaced
    with the underscore character (_).

    The following are recognized patterns:

      1. Add by wildcard.  model*.bin model* dir* d*r
      2. Add by literal.  model model123.bin dir/model dir1/dir2/model.bin

    When you use OT_KERNEL_FIRMWARE envvar, it is implied it will wipe the
    previous setting.

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_CPU_MICROCODE



    OT_KERNEL_FIRMWARE_AVSCAN - performs an avscan on firmware files.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - check
      0 - don't check
      unset - check (default)



    OT_KERNEL_FORCE_APPLY_DISABLE_DEBUG - force the applying disable debug
    globally to remove config symbols containing the following keywords:

      DEBUG, TRACE, VERBOSE, LOG, PRINT

    Acceptable values:

      1 to apply disable_debug, 0 to halt if there is a conflict between a
      kernel flag set and disable_debug.

    See also:

      DISABLE_DEBUG_EXCLUDES



    OT_KERNEL_FPS - Set it to the frames per second based on the recording
    standard.  It can be a multiple of 30 (corresponding to 300 HZ), or multiple
    of 25 (corresponding to 250 HZ).  This matters because some archs cannot use
    300 HZ.  This may help reduce the number of frames dropped in older
    processors or designs if set properly.

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_broadcast_video_formats
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL#/media/File:PAL-NTSC-SECAM.svg



    OT_KERNEL_PGO_FLAVOR - sets the flavor for PGO
    
    Acceptable values:

      CLANG_PGO   - Full PGO
      GCC_PGO_CFG - CFG only, Partial PGO
      GCC_PDO     - CFG only



    OT_KERNEL_HARDENING_LEVEL - sets the security mitigation level of the
    kernel.  In these ebuilds and eclasses - standard security hardening flags.

    Setting to performance also allows to use io_uring for more performance at
    the expense of security.

    Acceptable values:

      custom
      default
      manual
      fast
      fast-af
      practical
      performance
      secure
      secure-af
      unset

    Meanings:

      custom - Customize hardening.
      (Acceptable aliases:  manual, unset)

      default - Uses upstream default security settings, practically secure,
      balanced performance-security.  However, it does have unintended benefits
      such as being less crashy and longer uptimes TBH.
      (Acceptable aliases:  secure, hard, practical)

      fast-af - Trendy alias for performance but dangerous-af.  From experience,
      it does crash more.  It will turn off all hardening to reduce overhead
      or wasted CPU cycles.
      (Acceptable aliases:  fast, fast-af, fast-as-fuck, easy, performance,
      dangerous, dangerous-af, dangerous-as-fuck)

      secure-af - (aka secure as fuck) turns on full hardening.  It increases
      mitigation against theoretical attacks, mitigation against difficult to
      achieve attacks, mitigation against information disclosure.  The
      "see also" tunables below allow to apply potentially problematic
      mitigations conditionally based on experiental trial-and-error
      observations.  Idealistically, they should be ON by default but are
      disabled by default due to compatibility issues.
      The -af is intentional because it emphasizes extreme security measures.
      (Acceptable aliases:  secure-af, secure-as-fuck, hard-af, epic-boss)

      Note: secure-af was original envisioned to be an availability-first
      policy.  There are competing security objectives or philosophies.  For
      integrity-first policy set OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL=1.

      unset - same as custom.

    Acceptable values:

      1 for have, 0 do not have (optional), unset.  Unset is equivalent to 0.

    These will skip adding additional CPU optimized ciphers or hash algorithms
    in preference for the hardware accelerated crypto device implementation.
    While setting this flag, you still need to manually configure the kernel
    config to use the accelerated crypto device.  These should be set to 1
    if the accelerated crypto device supports the algorithm.  If not present,
    it will fall back to the CPU optimized or the generic non-optimized
    algorithm.

    IMPORTANT:

    Do not assume that the hardware algorithm is secure especially if
    obtained from or provided by a stranger or backdoored.

    The preference for hardware implementations of ciphers, hashes, RNG
    generators, end of life (EOL) compilers, etc is not endorsed by the ebuild
    maintainer.  This is due to most of these implementations being not
    transparent as in not open source hardware.  You should always check to see
    if the crypto integrated circut (IC) or CPU has reported hardware
    side-channels or design flaws.  If the hardware does have a flaw, consider
    replacing the hardware from a trusted vendor who can verify authenticity of
    that unit or use the software open source implementation from trusted vetted
    developers.

      OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_CPU



    OT_KERNEL_HWRAID - Set if SATA hardware raid is being used.  This may
    improve the throughput with the BFQ I/O scheduler.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - have hardware raid
      0 - no hardware raid
      unset - no hardware raid



    OT_KERNEL_IMA - Sets the mode for IMA.  IMA will essentially ensure
    system integrity with the use of hashing and filesystem metadata.
    IMA requires 2 steps - measurement and appraisal.  Measurement
    is done by hashing files.  Appraisal is done by comparing hashes.

    These kernel configs will be built in so the kernel needs to be rebuilt
    whenever it changes.

    Simplified progression diagram:

      start ➡️  rebuild with fix ➡️  reboot ➡️  rebuild with enforce ➡️  reboot ➡️  end

    (➡️  is the right emoji symbol)

    Acceptable values:

      fix - update the IMA hashes
      enforce - protect
      off - disables IMA
      unset - manual



    OT_KERNEL_IMA_HASH_ALG - Sets the default hashing algorithm

    Acceptable values:

      sha1, sha256, sha512, wp512, default, manual, unset

    sha1 is the default.  If unset, it will choose manual.



    OT_KERNEL_IMA_POLICIES - A space separated list of IMA policies.

    Acceptable values:

      critical_data - hash kernel critical data
      fail_securely - force signature failure on untrusted filesystems
      tcb - default hash of opened root files, modules, firmware, policy
      tcb_appraise - default apprasial of tcb set
      secure_boot - check module, firmware, policy, and signed kexec kernels
      unset - use manual setting

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_IMA_POLICIES="tcb"
      OT_KERNEL_IMA_POLICIES="tcb tcb_appraise"
      OT_KERNEL_IMA_POLICIES="tcb tcb_appraise secure_boot"



    OT_KERNEL_INIT - Set the value for init= as an argument to the internal
    built-in kernel command line.  This variable was intended to minimize human
    error with the auto option.

    Acceptable values:

     a path - The absolute path to the init program.
     auto - Automatically detect based on the presence of init package installed.
     custom (default) - You will manually set via /etc/default/grub
     dinit - Use init=/sbin/dinit
     epoch - Use init=/usr/sbin/epoch-init
     finit - Use init=/sbin/finit
     none - Removes init= from the built-in kernel command line
     openrc - Use init=/sbin/openrc-init
     runit - Use init=/sbin/runit-init
     s6 - Use init=/sbin/init
     systemd - Use init=/lib/systemd/systemd
     sysvinit - Use init=/sbin/init

    Meaning:

      supervisor - has a tool (e.g. systemctl, initctl) to communicate to the
        supervisor process to stop or start services
      sandboxing - chroot filesystem isolation, root/network capability
        management, resource limits between services.
      realtime - able to change services to realtime priority class

       D - For data centers
       d - For desktop users
       e - For embedded
       l - For legacy or software museum
       m - For music production[4]
       p - For non-sensitive data servers such as dedicated game server
       s - For sensitive data servers on LAN server, home server, SOHO,
           SSH server
    
      [1] - achieveable with OpenRC compatibility wrappers but not native
      [2] - chroot yes, unsharing namespaces no
      [3] - chroot yes, unsharing namespaces requires sys-apps/sandbox
      [4] - Native support similar to bubblewrap and sys-apps/sandbox

    Notes

      * auto is recommended but the common practice is to configure
        /etc/default/grub.  It can only be used when not cross compiling.
      * If init= is provided by the bootloader, it will override this internal
        setting except when lockdown is enabled.
      * It is recommended to set it to auto and remove the init= from boot.
      * It is *mandatory* to disable tmpfiles USE flag in systemd-utils for
        realtime.  The periodic cleanup feature will ruin the production, cause
        gaming loss, disrupt live performance, etc.
      * The speed of the init may vary on each machine based on several factors
        such as the starting order, enabled bit, service support for that init
        system.  It is possible to start the tty login before the blocking
        network service (e.g. NetworkManager, netifrc) start.
      * The explicit values are provided for cross compiling.
      * There are four s6 instructions.  Insane!  The s6 or auto options uses
        the quckstart.html upstream instructions.

    OT_KERNEL_INSTALL_SOURCE_CODE - Install the kernel source code.
    Install the source code implies copying the copyright notices.

    Acceptable values:

    0 - don't install
    1 - install
    n - don't install
    y - install
    unset -  install (default)

    Notes:

      - Explicit or implicit external modules will still force the install
        of the full source code.
      - Disabling the source code install will still install the minimal
        required and source code for portage to do version and kernel config
        checks.

    OT_KERNEL_IOMMU - Sets the default IOMMU domain type upon initalization.
    Setting this has implications with security and performance tradeoff.

    The OT_KERNEL_COLD_BOOT_MITIGATIONS have higher precedence when this
    option is used which allow only for lazy or strict.

    Acceptable values:

      manual - Use previous settings
      custom - Use previous settings
      disable - Disable the IOMMU.  Benefits tourney host level gaming.
      lazy - Restrict memory access.  Use delayed batch TLB invalidation.
        Throughput still significantly drops.
      strict - Restrict memory access.  Use slowest synchronous TLB
        invalidation.  Throughput significantly drops.
      pt - Trusted devices are given unrestricted memory access.  Option
        used by people that use virtual machines with near baremetal
        performance.  Passthrough reduces the VM overhead.

    OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OPENRC - Install the OpenRC init script(s) to
    autoset the kernel I/O scheduler per device.  If you do not generate
    and enable it, you are responsible to manually setting the I/O
    scheduler.

    Acceptable values

      1 - install (default)
      0 - don't install
      unset - install

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_HWRAID
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_SYSTEMD



    OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_SYSTEMD - Install the systemd init script(s) to
    autoset the kernel I/O scheduler per device.  If you do not generate
    and enable it, you are responsible to manually setting the I/O
    scheduler.

    Acceptable values

    OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED - A I/O scheduler list for the custom work profile
    (either OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE="custom" or OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE="manual").
    The first I/O scheduler corresponds to the I/O scheduler to apply to SSDs.
    The second I/O scheduler corresponds to the I/O scheduler to apply to HDDs.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED="none none"
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED="noop mq-deadline"
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED="noop mq-deadline"
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED="kyber bfq-throughput"
    
    Acceptable values:

      bfq - Alias for bfq-low-latency.  Virtual latency guarantees for
      interactive and soft-real-time (SRT) and weighted proportional throughput.
      By default, more weight is given to interactive/SRT and sequential I/O
      requests.

      bfq-low-latency - Variation optimized for interactive or soft-real-time
      I/O such as seeking for media players.  Has observed benefits in startup
      time.  This option does automatic weight adjustments with interatives, but
      can still be inferior in some scenarios.  For manual, weight adjustments
      use bfq-custom-interactive instead.

      bfq-custom-interactive - Variation optimized for precise interactivity
      under high I/O.  This option requires the use of ionice to manually adjust
      the weights manipulating the priority class (-c in ionice) and the class
      data (-n in ionice).  Work profiles notorious for high I/O such as
      builder-interactive will be assigned this.

      Beneficial one liners for bfq-custom-interactive:

        ionice -c 3 -p $(pgrep -G portage) # puts emerge in the idle class
        ionice -c 3 -p $(pgrep sah) # puts sah in the idle class
        ionice -c 2 -n 0 -p $(pgrep uzbl) # web browser
        ionice -c 2 -n 0 -p $(pgrep mplayer) # streaming service
        # ionice -c 3 means idle and heaviest I/O programs should use this value.
        # ionice -c 2 means best effort to be used by interactive.
        # ionice -n 0 is highest priority in that priority class in the best effort class.
        # ionice -n 7 is low priority in that priority class in the best effort class.

      The recommendations above may change or better solution provided later.
      See also PORTAGE_IONICE_COMMAND in "man make.conf".

      bfq-streaming - Same as bfq-low-latency but designed to prevent dropped
      video frames at the expense of throughput.  This option uses automatic
      weight adjustments.

      bfq-throughput - Variation to maximize MB/s disabling boosting weights
      for interactive processes.

      cfq - Round robin fairness with timeslices (4.14 only)

      kyber - Ensures that the queues meets latency goals

      mq-deadline - Sorted I/O with grouped deployment

      none - Disables I/O scheduling

      noop - FIFO I/O scheduling with request merging (4.14 only)

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OVERRIDE
      OT_KERNEL_HWRAID



    OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OVERRIDE - A space delimited list of id;iosched.  The id
    is obtained from the basename in "ls -l /dev/disk/by-id".  The id should
    be the device itself not a partition.  The reason for this is that
    the kernel may mistakenly flag USB flash disks as rotational.  This also
    allows for USB rotational and USB flash to be precisely given the proper
    scheduler or to override the auto applied values if you need latency
    guarantees.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OVERRIDE="ata-XXX_XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX_XX-XXXXXXXXXXXX;bfq-low-latency"
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OVERRIDE="ata-XXX_XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX_XX-XXXXXXXXXXXX;bfq-throughput usb-XXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-0:0;none"
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OVERRIDE="usb-YYYYYYYY_YYYY_YYYY_YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY-0:0;hdd usb-XXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-0:0;flash"
      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED_OVERRIDE="ata-XXX_XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXX_XX-XXXXXXXXXXXX;rotational"

    Acceptable values for iosched

      All acceptable values listed in OT_KERNEL_IOSCHEDS

      hdd - Large mechanical platter type
      ssd - Large NAND memory storage 
      flash - NAND memory storage for use by USB or cameras (alias for ssd)
      rotational - alias for HDD

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_IOSCHED



    OT_KERNEL_IRQ_REMAP - Sets IRQ remapping for virtual machine hypervisors
    or hosts to prevent malicious MSIs.  This option enables use of x2APIC
    mode.

    Acceptable values:

      1 (default when iommu is pt, lazy, or strict), 0, unset

    Unset is the same as manual.



    OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG - A set of key-value pairs used to enable or disable
    drivers or set options in the kernel config.  This is another convenient way
    to change the default config slightly without wasting minutes in menuconfig
    hunting down for the flag, or to quickly enable driver support on top of the
    default kernel config.  If an ebuild package(s) announces flags, you can
    easily add them using this.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_HZ_1000]=n
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_HZ_250]=y
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_MTRR]=y
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_MTRR]=" "
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_DEFAULT]=2
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_MEDIA_SUPPORT]=m
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_LSM]="integrity,apparmor,bpf"
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE]="\"vendor1/model1.bin vendor2/model2.bin vendor3/model3.bin\""

      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_BLOCK]=y
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_LESS_THAN_256KB]=y
      OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_BTRFS_FS]=y

    Notes:

      * You may use "y" to to enable the driver.
      * You may use "n" or " " to disable the driver.
      * All flags get evaluated from top to bottom order.
      * To ensure that the flag gets enabled, add all flags under "Depends on".
        This info can be found in the menuconfig help screen or inspecting
        the Kconfig file directly from git repo viewer.
      * You do not need to declare the array.
      * These get evaluated at the end of the kernel assist configuration.
      * You must add an escaped double quote with backslash for values with
        spaces.
      * Every option must be prefixed with CONFIG_

       OT_KERNEL_CONFIG



    OT_KERNEL_KERNEL_COMPILER_PATCH_PROVIDER - Sets the upstream provider of the patch.

    Acceptable values:

      graysky2   - (default in lts/stable) Use the kernel_compiler_patch directly from the creator of the patchset.
      zen-sauce  - Use the zen-sauce version of kernel_compiler_patch
      genpatches - Use the genpatches version of kernel_compiler_patch
      none       - (default for live) Disables kernel_compiler_patch
      disable    - Disables kernel_compiler_patch

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_KERNEL_COMPILER_PATCH_LEVEL



    OT_KERNEL_KERNEL_DIR - Sets and overrides the install location to install
    the kernel.

    Acceptable values:
      path - It must be an absolute path.
      unset - Sets to /boot



    OT_KERNEL_KEXEC - Sets kexec config to allow to reboot into a new kernel
    instantly.  Booting into a poorly configured destination kernel can lead to
    severe security holes.  It is not recommended to use this feature unless the
    destination kernels are signed and updated daily.

    The OT_KERNEL_DMA_ATTACK_MITIGATIONS has higher priority and may
    override this choice.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - Enables kexec support
      0 - Disables kexec support
      unset - Use manual settings

      OT_KERNEL_IMA
      OT_KERNEL_IMA_POLICIES



    OT_KERNEL_LED_EVENTS - A space delimited of types of events to allow LED
    illumination.

    Valid values:

      backlight - Allow LED illumination for backlight devices when unblanked
      camera - Allow to illuminate the main bright flash and the small light indicators
      cpu - Allow the corresponding LED to illuminate with the corresponding active CPU or corresponding core
      default-on - Allow LEDs to illuminate immediately when turned on
      disk - Allow LED illumination on ATA disk activity
      events - Allow LED illumination of events based single blink event or blink at a slower constant rate for rapid multiple events

      netdev - Allow LEDs to illuminate on network activity
      panic - Allow LEDs to blink when a kernel panic is detected
      pattern - Allow artsy LED patterns support
      systemwide-activity - Allow the LED to illuminate based on overall system load
      timer - Allow the LED to illuminate based on a timer
      tty - Allow LEDs to blink on corresponding tty or serial device activity

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_LED_EVENTS="cpu disk"

      OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_LED



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_AVSCAN - Perform antivirus scan on image before running
      image *magick conversion and adding to kernel if avscanner available.

    Acceptable values:

      0 - disable
      1 - enable
      unset - enable (default)



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_LICENSE_URI - A uri, local file containing the license

    Acceptable values:

      url - An image off the internet.
      absolute path to local file - A path locally on the device
      unset - skip license copy

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_LICENSE_URI="https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/plain/licenses/CC-BY-3.0"
      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_LICENSE_URI="file:///home/user/logo.license"
      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_LICENSE_URI="/home/user/logo.license"



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_MAGICK_ARGS - Args to pass to the converter

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_MAGICK_ARGS="-geometry x112 -colors 224"
      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_MAGICK_ARGS="-geometry x80 -colors 224"

    Notes:

      - Using the kernel logo will restore console logging levels to default,
        which may decrease security.
      - The -geometry option is used to scale the image preserving aspect ratio.
      - The value of -geometry cannot exceed the framebuffer width or height.
      - The -colors can only be 1, 16, 224 to indicate the maxiumum
        allowed colors.
      - You may specify more args.
      - The old logos dimensions do not scale well in current times.  The ratio
        is approximately .166, .133, .10416 the height of 640x480, 800x600,
        1366x768 monitors circa 2008.  So if you have a 1080p monitor (or
        1920x1080) or 4k monitor, a flag as a logo should be 144 pixels or 224
        pixels respectively in height to properly scale for newer monitors, so
        logos do not appear tiny, or feel archaic useless, but remain nostalgic
        as in circa 2008.  Larger full screen logos should be possible like
        with Dracut / Plymouth.
      - The dimensions should be an even number and divisible by 4.
      - See https://imagemagick.org/script/magick.php for additional arguments
        or clarification of the examples above.



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS_PATH - This is an absolute path to the
    preprocessor script.  This script can apply a series of extra manipulation
    on the logo such as distortions (wavy flag), or text annotations, or color
    tinting to the logo, or drawing borders, or waifu2x style upscaling.  The
    image_in_path bash variable will contain the path to the image.  The final
    image must be the same image format and the same filename contained in
    image_in_path.

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS_PATH="/etc/portage/ot-sources/6.1/gaming/x86_64/logo_preprocess.sh"

    Notes:

      - The script must have root:root and 700 permissions.
      - The script must be a bash script.
      - OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS_SHA512 and OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS_BLAKE2B
        needs to be defined.
      - See the following links:

          https://imagemagick.org/Usage/distorts/
          https://imagemagick.org/Usage/annotating/
          https://imagemagick.org/Usage/

      - You may use other programs other than *magick package to achieve the
        desired results.
      - GPU usage may require extra ebuild/eclass modding so the CPU algorithm
        is preferred or preprocessing done prior to emerging.
      - This script can be used in creative good way like a image of the day
        changer, but also it can be a weakness (as in being hacked).  It is
        not recommended to do web activities during this time or allow
        external shell scripts from the web to run.



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS_SHA512 - sha512 checksum for OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS script.
    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS_BLAKE2B - blake2b checksum for OT_KERNEL_LOGO_PREPROCESS script..

    Notes:

      - Use `sha512sum /etc/portage/ot-sources/6.1/gaming/x86_64/logo_preprocess.sh | cut -f 1 -d " "` to obtain the sha512 checksum.
      - Use `rhash --blake2b /etc/portage/ot-sources/6.1/gaming/x86_64/logo_preprocess.sh | cut -f 1 -d " "` to obtain the blake2b checksum



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_COUNT - number of times to show the logo. (EXPERIMENTAL)

    Acceptable values:

      1 to number of online CPUs - an integer.
      auto - use the number of online CPUs (upstream default)



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_FOOTNOTES - save notes to a file next to the optional license file. (EXPERIMENTAL)

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_FOOTNOTES="Photo:  Comet 2023.01.27 C-22-E3-ZTF 500 F5.  Credits: Auvo Korpi.  License: CC-BY-2.0."

    Notes:

      - Nested double quotes need to be escaped with \" or be replaced with single
        quotes.
      - The fille will found in /usr/share/${PN}/${PV}-${extraversion}/licenses/logo/logo_footnotes
      - It is a good way to save attribution to higher quality CC-BY licensed
        photos.

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_FOOTNOTES_ON_INIT



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_FOOTNOTES_ON_INIT - Display the notes on init boot. (EXPERIMENTAL)
    This will automatically turn on early printk.

    Depends on:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_FOOTNOTES

    Acceptable values:

      1 - show
      0 - don't show
      unset - don't show (default)



    OT_KERNEL_LOGO_URI - A URI, local file, or pre-bundled logo provided by the
    package.

    Acceptable values:
    url - An image off the Internet.
    absolute path to local file - A path locally on the device
    pre-bundled logos - See

      https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/video/logo

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_URI="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Flag_of_Ukraine.svg"
      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_URI="logo_linux_clut224.ppm"
      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_URI="file:///home/user/logo.jpg"
      OT_KERNEL_LOGO_URI="/home/user/logo.jpg"

    Notes:

      - Custom logos or images provided require imagemagick or graphicsmagick
        installed via the respective USE flag.
      - Positives for using a kernel logo are ease of deployment, fewest changes,
        short term satisfaction.
      - Negatives for using a kernel logo are it will likely break the seamless
        integration between initramfs or init system logo transition.
      - It requires that the network-sandbox be disabled if logos are fetched
        from the Internet.
      - The logo must be license compatible with the kernel.
      - The logo must abide by acceptable trademark use agreements.
      - The logo from the Internet must come from a vetted reliable source to
        prevent being hacked.
      - The logos provided by the kernel are 80x80 or 40x40 with either
        1, 16, 225 colors.
      - For seemless boot logos or animated logos, it is recommended to use
        Dracut and Plymouth packages instead of the kernel logo.
        Kernel logos are stills.



    OT_KERNEL_LSMS - Enable and set the order for LSM (Linux Security Modules)

    Acceptable multi values: apparmor, bpf, capability, integrity, landlock,
    loadpin, lockdown, safesetid, selinux, smack, tomoyo, yama.

    Acceptable general values:  auto, default, manual

    * auto - Auto adds LSMs based on packages installed and OT_KERNEL_HARDENING_LEVEL.
      - If OT_KERNEL_HARDENING_LEVEL=fast-af or similar it will disable LSMs.
      - If OT_KERNEL_HARDENING_LEVEL=secure or above it will enable and auto-detect LSMs.
    * default - Uses "integrity,selinux,bpf" with default subsettings
      equivalent to upstream defaults.  It is implied capability and
      integrity are loaded.
    * manual - Uses previously manually set settings
    * a custom list

    The "acceptable multi values" and "acceptable general values" are mutually
    exclusive.  In acceptable multi values listing, the LSMs needs to be comma
    separated and mutiple LSMs can be used.  In acceptable general values
    only one value can be used which are associated with a precreated
    listing.

    For a newly generated kernel .config with not set OT_KERNEL_LSMS, it will
    apply auto setting.  For previous installs with OT_KERNEL_LSMS is not set,
    it will apply manual.

    It is recommended to use auto if you are using
    OT_KERNEL_AUTO_CONFIGURE_KERNEL_FOR_PKGS=1.  Otherwise, it assumes that
    the user wants exact and full control over the LSM inclusion and ordering.

    Example:

      OT_KERNEL_LSMS="integrity,lockdown,yama,selinux"



    OT_KERNEL_MAX_UPTIME - Optimize the kernel to maximize uptime.  This setting
    is to mitigate against irreversable losses (hardcore mode, lost work) or
    embrassing crashes.  (EXPERIMENTAL, WIP)

    Acceptable values:  1 - max uptime, 0 - unstable (default)

    The following work profiles maximize uptime unconditionally:
    
    database-server
    datacenter-backend
    digital-audio-workstation
    dss
    gamedev
    game-server
    gaming-tournament
    musical-live-performance
    pi-deep-learning
    pi-music-production
    presentation
    pro-gaming
    ros
    website-enterprise
    website-interactive
    website-small
    workstation

    See Also

      OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL



    OT_KERNEL_MESSAGE - Print a message near the end of the kernel init.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_MESSAGE="Return lost computer to ... at address ... call me at ..."



    OT_KERNEL_N_CPUS - Sets the max number of CPUs.



    OT_KERNEL_MENUCONFIG_COLORS - Sets the colors for menuconfig.

    Acceptable values:

      mono - black and white
      blackbg - black with colored borders
      classic - similiar to default but with yellow text
      bluetitle - default colored with black text designed for LCDs



    OT_KERNEL_MENUCONFIG_RUN_AT - Sets the location to run the menuconfig
    wrapper.

    Acceptable values:

      pre - Allow the user to run menuconfig wrapper before ebuild changes.
        This is suitable for enabling just drivers and minor edits.
      post - Allow the user to run menuconfig wrapper after ebuild changes.
        This is suitable for manual edits or mistakes by the ebuild itself.



    OT_KERNEL_MENUCONFIG_UI - Select the menu to use when running the
    wrapper.  When this value is set to a UI, the emerge will prematurely quit
    to allow to configure it using a wrapper script.  Due to interactive bugs,
    this workaround is used instead.  The menuconfig access in the ebuild
    was provided primarily to enable drivers.

    Valid values:

      config - Use line-by-line prompt frontend
      menuconfig - Use lxdialog menu frontend using ncurses
      nconfig - Use ncurses frontend
      gconfig - Use GTK+2 frontend
      xconfig - Use Qt5/Qt6 frontend
      disable - disables menuconfig
      none - disables menuconfig

    If unset, it assumes disabled.

    For the full list, see

      https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/scripts/kconfig/Makefile#L118



    OT_KERNEL_MODULES_SUPPORT - Enables or disable modules support.
    For unsigned kernel modules, this will prevent loading hacked modules.
    If a option is still a module and modules support is disable, it will
    convert all modules into builtins.

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, y, n, unset

    Unset is equivalent to maunal or previous settings if using previous config,
    or default config if new config.



    OT_KERNEL_MODULES_COMPRESSOR (optional) - compresses the kernel
    modules.

    Acceptable values:

      NONE, GZIP, XZ, ZSTD

    If not set, it will use the manual setting.  NONE and ZSTD are only allowed
    with 5.15+.  When a new kernel config is generated, module compression is
    disabled; but can be overrided by explicitly setting it to one of the
    acceptable values.



    OT_KERNEL_NEST_FREQ_GOV - change the default for the frequency governor.
    This sets the default.  Overall schedutil dominates performance with nest
    based on benchmarks,  but you can refine optimizing the performance by
    selecting either one during runtime.

    Acceptable values:

      performance, schedutil


    OT_KERNEL_NETFILTER - a space delimited list of kernel config symbols.

    Acceptable values:

      For netfilter ebt, see

        https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/bridge/netfilter/Kconfig

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_NETFILTER="NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_ADDRTYPE NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_CONNTRACK NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_IPVS IP_NF_FILTER IP6_NF_FILTER BRIDGE_EBT_T_NAT IP_VS_PROTO_UDP IP_VS_RR"
      OT_KERNEL_NETFILTER="IP_VS_SH_TAB_BITS=8 CONFIG_IP_VS_MH_TAB_INDEX=12"



    OT_KERNEL_PAGE_SIZE - Change the page size for reasons of performance,
    energy savings, security.  This may require certain software to be
    recompiled if this information is gained at compile time.  The numbers
    are in KB.

    Acceptable values:

      A number:
        alpha:  4
        arm:  4
        arm64:  4, 16, 64
        loongarch:  4, 16, 64
        m68k:  4, 8                          8 for CONFIG_SUN3=y or CONFIG_COLDFIRE=y; 4 for others
        parisc:  4, 16, 64                   (2)
        powerpc:  4, 16, 64, 256             (1)(4)
        mips:  4, 8, 16, 32                  (1)
        riscv:  4
        s390:  4
        sparc:  4, 8                         8 for a 64-bit compiler, 4 for others
        x86:  4
      big-data - optimized for HPC
      compact - produce the least wasted space
      custom - use current kernel config values
      default - use upstream defaults
      disable - skip setting but use custom values
      low-power - fewest CPU cycles wasted on managing the page table and page metadata
      max - largest page size supported by hardware in kernel config
      min - smallest page size supported by hardware in kernel config
      pgsql - Match PostgreSQL default page size
      security - increased page isolation
      sql - Match InnoDB default page size
      unset - same as custom

    (1) The values listed may have dependencies or not work in certain configurations.
    (2) 16, 64 are marked broken upstream
    (3) Performance for parisc (aka hppa) implies (2)
    (4) Only 64kb supported.
        It may likely require a modified bintools built with crossdev.
        (https://lore.kernel.org/all/200710181108.19413.yur@emcraft.com/T/#u)
    (5) If using a database package, both the database page size and the
        kernel's memory page size should be the same and the largest
        supported by the CPU and the linker.  For example,

          bfd supports 64 KB pages maxiumum.
          A database supports 16 KB, 32 KB, 64 KB pages.
          The CPU supports 64 KB and 256 KB.
          The largest common denominator is 64 KB.

    (6) If the DB supports a larger size than what is available by the CPU
        the half sized granularity is chosen.  For example a DB uses 8 KB
        as the page size, but the cpu supports only 4 KB an 16 KB.  4 KB
        will be preferred for that symbolic value.

    Notes:

    - Using this feature may disable options that decrease the index
      range or addressable range, meaning that the physical memory may
      not be fully utilized.
    - Changing the page size may require emerging packages that obtain
      page size information during configure time or build time.
    - Some architectures use a fixed page size with 1 or 2 values that has no
      effect when setting this value.
    - Non numerical values are only supported in non fixed page size
      architectures.
    - Because it may create new bugs in userspace apps, the default if
      not set is custom.
    - You can choose only one value.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_PAGE_SIZE="64"
      OT_KERNEL_PAGE_SIZE="sql"



    OT_KERNEL_PCIE_MPS - sets the Maximum Paylond Size (MPS) and Max Read
    Request Size (MRRS).  This setting may improve performance by reducing
    overhead and packets transferred.

    Acceptable values:

      bios - use bios defaults
      default - use PCIe bridge value
      hotplug-optimal - alias for default
      hotplug-safe - MPS lowered for compatibility to prevent hotplug fail
      p2p-safe - MPS lowered for compatibility with PCIe-to-PCIe to prevent fail
      performance - use max parent MPS and increase MRRS to no more than MPS
      safe - max MPS common to all devices at boot
      unset - use manual settings



    OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_ACCEPT - a key-value pair(s) of auto apply-able kernel
    config symbols to accept per package-wise.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_ACCEPT[S05309e2]=1
      OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_ACCEPT[S351365c]=1

    Notes:

      - You must prefix the id with an S.
      - You do not need to declare the associative array.

    See also:

      Kernel pkgflags environment variables



    OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_REJECT - is a key-value pair(s) auto apply-able kernel
    config symbols to reject.  These sets of flags are identified (id) with a 7
    digit hash code and used to either skip the config and apply the config
    manually or permit a disable_debug conflict to priorize disable_debug
    removal of debug keyworded kernel config symbols.

    Currently, this does not unset the kernel config flags but means that it
    will not apply the set of kernel configs.  One must manually unset these
    options.  The reason why it is not so easy to automate unsetting is
    because some of these settings may have multiple dependence on a kernel
    config.

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_REJECT[S1ee4e36]=1
      OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_REJECT[S155d9fc]=1
      OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_REJECT[S27ea6ce]=1

    Notes:

      - You must prefix the id with an S.
      - You do not need to declare the associative array.

    See also:

      Kernel pkgflags environment variables



    OT_KERNEL_PKU - enables PKU (Memory Protection Keys) for supported
    hardware.

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, auto, unset

    Unset is the same as auto.



    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_AUDIO - Set the power level for the audio system
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_BT_USB - Set the power level for Bluetooth USB devices
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_CPU - Set the power level for CPUs, or SoC MCs and/or mobile GPUs
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_DISPLAY - Set the power level for display sleep states
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_DISPLAY_BACKLIGHT - Set the power level for display backlights
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_LED - Set the power level for device status blinker lights
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_PCI - Set the power level for PCI
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_SATA - Set the power level for SATA
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_USB - Set the power level for USB
    OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_WIFI - Set the power level for 802.11 devices

    Some of these settings may have a dramatic effect while others neglible effect.
    These are used for fine grain control over power consumption which can
    translate to overheating management or operational availability/correctness.

    For OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_LED, it will only illuminate when set to 1;
    otherwise, it will disable to reduce execution latency or disable to reduce
    power consumption.

    The OT_KERNEL_POWER_LEVEL_* control the general or broad kernel config
    options.  For specific/multifunctional options or devices, you need to
    manually select them.  Some platform drivers used to control laptop or
    smartphones Wi-Fi switch, backlights, programmable function keys, or LEDs
    need to be manually added to the kernel config by using
    OT_KERNEL_MENUCONFIG_UI=menuconfig or with the OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG array
    (e.g. OT_KERNEL_KCONFIG[CONFIG_ASUS_LAPTOP]=y).

    Valid settings depending on the perspectives:

      Heat level perspective, the default assumption
      2 = High tolerance (which is equivalent to always-on)
      1 = Mid tolerance (which is equivalent to on-demand)
      0 = Weak tolerance (which is equivalent to the lowest power consumption)

      Power savings perspective
      red = No power savings
      yellow = Some power savings
      green = Max power savings

      Energy blend perspective from non air conditioned room
      winter-blend = Alias for 2
      spring-blend = Alias for 1
      summer-blend = Alias for 0
      fall-blend = Alias for 1

      Battery perspective
      ac = Charging AC power, alias for 2
      battery = More than 10% battery left, alias for 1
      low-battery = 10% or less battery left, alias for 0

      Alternatively, you may use the following power management aliases
      always-on = Alias for 2
      on-demand = Alias for 1
      lowest-power = Alias for 0

      Mobile perspective
      charging = Charging, alias for 2
      battery = Battery, alias for 1

      Performance perspective which bandwidth may be reduced
      performance = Alias for 2
      balance = Alias for 1
      stable = Alias for 0

      Lifespan perspective
      short-life = Alias for 2
      avg-life = Alias for 1
      long-life = Alias for 0

      LED perspective
      blink = Illuminate
      no-blink = Off to to reduce jitter or command latency or energy use

      Backlight perspective
      2 = Backlight full or manually adjusted directly on display panel
      1 = Backlight adjustable assuming with battery with special/programmable key functions
      0 = Backlight adjustable assuming with low battery, but the userspace battery event handler should set backlight levels to lowest or disabled

    OT_KERNEL_PRESERVE_HEADER_NOTICES - Preserves copyright notices for binary
    only installation.

    Important:  You still need to save the source code and patches for some
    licenses such as the GPL.

    Notes:

      - When preserving headers, false positives or partial fragments may appear.
      - It may take hours to achieve this extraction.
      - This is only useful when doing binary install and without external
        modules.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - install preserved headers
      0 - skip (default due to the assumption tarballs and patches were saved)

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_PRESERVE_HEADER_NOTICES_CACHED



    OT_KERNEL_PRESERVE_HEADER_NOTICES_CACHED - Use a cached copy to save time
    when performing point upgrades.  This option is only valid in the same
    major.minor version. (EXPERIMENTAL)

    Acceptable values:

      1 - use a cached copy if available (default)
      0 - produce a fresh new copy
      unset - produce a fresh new copy

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_PRESERVE_HEADER_NOTICES_CACHED

    Depends on:

      OT_KERNEL_PRESERVE_HEADER_NOTICES=1



    OT_KERNEL_PRIMARY_EXTRAVERSION (optional) - sets the primary extraversion
    for the symlink USE flag.  If not set, it defaults to ot.



    OT_KERNEL_PRIMARY_EXTRAVERSION_WITH_TRESOR (optional) - sets the primary
    extraversion for tresor_sysfs USE flag.  If not set, it defaults to ot.



    OT_KERNEL_PRIVATE_KEY - The absolute path to a .pem private key file
    used for module signing.  This should only be set in the command line
    not saved in any make.conf, any per package configuration file, any
    env.  When done the variable should be overritten a new string and
    then not set.

    * Example:

# Scramble path if possible: \
OT_KERNEL_PRIVATE_KEY=$(dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/stdout bs=255 count=1 \
	status=none \
	| base64 | tr "\n" " " | sed -e "s| ||g")

# Remove the variable from memory: \
unset OT_KERNEL_PRIVATE_KEY



    OT_KERNEL_PROCESSOR_CLASS - sets the type of CPU class for used in this
    kernel.  This will reduce or increase latency.  If you do not see separate
    memory banks per socket, it probably means it is not designed for NUMA.
    Setting this may change the memory allocator which may affect the network

    OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL - Perform runtime monitoring and protection.

    There are competing security objectives for security.  Always-available and
    execution-integrity are mutually exclusive.  This setting is
    execution-integrity first meaning that in secure contexts, it should never
    be compromised.  If a vulnerability is detected, the computer should stop
    whether or not the vulnerability is taken advantage of and exploited for the
    benefit of the attacker(s).  It assumes that it is better to halt than to
    continue unauthorized anything that gives the attacker an advantage at the
    cost of you or the other people involved.  These sanitizers types may also
    trigger on false positives.  A crash can be a negative experience that leads
    to lost work or changes a good day into a bad day.  This is is why
    OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL is default off except for the dss work profile.

    In any case, it does a kernel panic crash on the kernel before running
    attacker's code, or crashes the kernel before running unauthorized changes,
    or crashes the kernel before running attacker's exfiltration code.

    Unconditionally enabled for work profiles:

    dss

    Acceptable values:

    1 - protect and crash
    0 - do not protect but maximize uptime availability (default, same as upstream)
    unset - same as 0

    OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL_TYPES - A list of sanitizer types to protect
    the kernel.  The default is KASAN, UBSAN, CFI, KCFI when
    OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL=1.

    Sanitizer  | Supported versions | Threats mitigated   | Performance impact | Production ready | Estimated CVSS 3.1 Severity | Estimated false positives
    cfi        |  = 5.15            | CE, PE              | 1.05 -  1.15x      | Maybe            | High - Critical             | 0.1 - 1 %
    kasan      | >= 4.0             | CE, DT, DoS, DT, ID | 2.00 -  5.00x      | Yes              |  Low - Critical             | < 1 %
    kcfi       | >= 6.1             | CE, PE              | 1.05 -  1.50x      | Maybe            | High - Critical             | < 0.1 %
    kcsan      | >= 5.8             | DoS, DT, ID         | 1.50 -  3.00x      | Yes              |  Low - Medium               | 1 - 5 %
    kfence     | >= 5.12            | CE, DT, DoS, DT, ID | 1.01 -  1.10x      | Yes              |  Low - Critical             | 1 - 5 %
    kmsan      | >= 6.1             | ID                  | 3.00 - 10.00x      | No               |  Low - High                 | < 1 %
    scs        | >= 5.8             | CE, PE              | 1.01 -  1.05x      | Maybe            | High - Critical             | 0 %
    ubsan      | >= 4.5             | CE, PE, DoS, DT, ID | 1.10 -  2.00x      | Yes              |  Low - Critical             | < 0.1 %

    CE = Code Execution
    DoS = Denial of Service
    DT = Data Tampering
    ID = Information Disclosure
    PE = Privilege Escalation

    KASAN Mode | Supported versions | Performance impact | Sampled? | Compatibility
    HW_TAGS    | >= 5.11            | 1.05x - 1.25x      | Yes      | Adding cpu_flags_arm_mte to both USE and OT_KERNEL_USE will use HW_TAGS.
    SW_TAGS    | >= 5.0             | 1.20x - 2.00x      | Yes      | Fallback for arm64
    GENERIC    | >= 5.0             | 1.50x - 4.00x      | No       | Fallback for non-arm64 CPUs.

    1.5x means 1.5 times slower than the base which is unmitigated and optimized
    for performance.

    4.0x means 4 times slower compared to the base which is unmitigated and
    optimized for performance.

    The estimated CVSS 3.1 severity ranges reflect the vulnerability not the
    sanitizer.   The KASAN or KFENCE sanitizers for example would block use
    after free vulnerabilities that are marked critical before they were
    taken advantage of by attackers.  This is to block giving away full
    capabilities to attacker(s).

    Use KASAN or KFENCE to halt on several undiscovered vulnerabilities to
    mitigate against memory corruption.  Examples include use after free, double
    free, heap overflow, stack overflow.  KASAN and KFENCE have overlap.  Do not
    use both at the same time.  KASAN has overlap with stack overflow
    protection.  KFENCE does not protect against stack overflow.  For Rust based
    drivers, it is recommended to use KASAN and kernel versions >= 6.12 for
    proper SSP and HOP protection.  SSP is Stack Smashing Protection and HOP is
    Heap Overflow Protection.  Both SSP and HOP mitigate against code execution
    and privilege escalation.

    KASAN is comprehensive.  The HW_TAGS, SW_TAGS, GENERIC are automagic but
    still require you choose kasan.

    KASAN_SAMPLE_INTERVAL is set to 1 by default, meaning each page of memory
    is tagged for security-critical inspection for memory corruption.  This
    tunable applies only HW_TAGS and SW_TAGS.

    KFENCE is faster and sampled based meaning that it doesn't inspect every
    allocation/deallocation/use.

    KFENCE_SAMPLE_INTERVAL is set to 10 ms by default, meaning every 10 ms
    the memory is checked for memory corruption.

    Use KCSAN to halt on concurrency violations.

    Use CFI to halt on compromised execution integrity with just pointer
    functions.  It requires LTO.

    Use KCFI to halt on compromised execution integrity with both pointer
    functions and some static function calls connected with the entry point
    of modules or exported symbols.  It doesn't need LTO, so build time is
    fast.

    Use SCS to halt on ROP detection.  Usually SCS is paired with CFI for
    complete CFI coverage.

    Use MSAN to halt on uninitalized memory.  This catches sensitive data leaks
    from unsanitized memory before memory is being used.

    Use UBSAN to halt on several undiscovered vulnerabilities/exploits to
    mitigate against undefined behavior.  Examples include signed integer
    overflow, out of bounds access, null pointer dereference.

    If you use KASAN+UBSAN, the build times may almost double or the worst
    case FPS may dip below 50 FPS.

    For casual gaming, software developers, or builder machines, use KFENCE+UBSAN.
    For dss (government, e-commerce), use KASAN+UBSAN.

      OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL_EXCLUSIONS


    OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL_EXCLUSIONS - Apply performance-critical
    sanitizer exclusions to drivers and subsystems.  The idea is to get most
    of the mitigation coverage of the sanitizers but not penalize in
    performance-critical sections.  The kernel does not conveniently allow to
    specify sanitizer exceptions to these sections. (DEVELOPMENT, PLANNED)

    When these exceptions are added, it may regain the lost single digit FPS or 
    decrease compile times by single or double digit hours for KASAN+UBSAN
    relative to the build without performance-critical exceptions.

    Acceptable values:

      A list of subsystems to exclude for KASAN, KFENCE, UBSAN treatment:

      alsa
      block
      cpu-scheduler
      file-systems
      interrupts
      io-scheduler
      timers
      video-codecs
      video-drivers

    Examples:

      # For devs or builder machines
      # For SSDs, you may remove block and file-systems from the list.
      # For HDDs, you may need block and file-systems added the list to mitigate against jitter.

      # For video conferencing
      OT_KERNEL_SECURITY_CRITICAL_EXCLUSIONS="cpu-scheduler video-codecs"

    OT_KERNEL_SLAB_ALLOCATOR - Set the slab allocator

    Acceptable values:
      auto - Auto detect based on kernel config
      custom - Use previous settings.
      manual - Use previous settings.
      slab - Use old allocator.  Recommended for networked computers for ~10%
        more network TPS (throughput) and systems with ~2 % lower CPU usage
        (and energy consumed).  However, this may slow down the emerge unpack
        phase.  Removed in the 6.8 series and newer.
      slob - Use allocator for embedded (e.g. gadgets, mp3 players).
        Removed in the 6.4 series and newer.  Use slub-tiny instead.
      slub - Use allocator for super computers and upstream default with SMP
        systems.  It has lower GiB overhead compared to slab in 1000+ processor
        systems.
      slub-tiny - Use slub optimized for embedded but lowers security.
      unset - It uses auto

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_PROCESSOR_CLASS



    OT_KERNEL_SGX - sets SGX (Software Guard eXtensions) support for supported
    hardware.

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, auto, unset

    Unset is the same as auto.



    OT_KERNEL_SIGN_MODULES (optional) - signs kernel modules with sha384
    or sha512.  This option is dependent on OT_KERNEL_MODULES_SUPPORT=y.

    Acceptable values:

      sha384, sha512, unset, 1, 0, manual

    If setting to 1, it will use sha384.  Setting to unset will assume manual.
    Setting to 0 will disable module signing and disable module sign
    verification.

    When a new kernel config is generated, module signing is disabled; but it
    can be signed by setting this to 1.  If module signing is enabled,
    it is recommended to sign external modules or these modules may no
    longer work.  External module signing is especially important especially
    for kernel graphics modules if module signing is enabled.  It is not
    forced default on to prevent any unprepared disruption.  See
    OT_KERNEL_PRIVATE_KEY section also.

    IMPORTANT:

      When OT_KERNEL_SIGN_MODULES is enabled, if the OT_KERNEL_PRIVATE_KEY
      and OT_KERNEL_SHARED_KEY are not specified, the kernel will
      autogenerate keys in the certs folder of the kernel sources.  These
      keys will be installed but the private key should be copied to a
      secure place such a encrypted store contained in a keychain or by
      steganography; and then the installed private key .pem file in the
      certs folder should be cryptographically securely destroyed with shred
      (or any secure delete program).  This is to prevent recovery and reuse
      of the private key by an untrusted user.  The private key temporarily
      stored in the certs folder should be destroyed in within 24 hours.
      Each build configuration will have a unique private-shared keys if
      using autogenerated, so all keys need to be stored and properly labeled
      to prevent mixup.



    OT_KERNEL_SIGN_KERNEL (WIP) - Cryptographically sign the kernel for the
    type of system and install the kernel to the EFI partition if possible.

    Acceptable values:

      uefi, efi, kexec, none, not set



    OT_KERNEL_SHARED_KEY - The absolute path to a .x509 shared key file
    used for module signing.



    OT_KERNEL_SME - allow support for Secure Memory Encryption for
    supported hardware.  This feature is not enabled by default due to
    possible boot failure.  To test, set OT_KERNEL_SME to 1 and bootloader
    with mem_encrypt=on.  If it works after testing, you must set
    OT_KERNEL_SME_DEFAULT_ON=1 to complete protection.

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, auto, unset

    Unset is the same as auto.



    OT_KERNEL_SME_DEFAULT_ON - sets SME ON at boot.  This requires
    OT_KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS to have all kernel args that would be normally
    specified in the bootline to be builtin.  It will automatically add
    mem_encrypt=on and the kernel commandline provided by the bootloader
    is ignored to mitigate against an evil maid attack.

    Acceptable values:

      1, 0, unset

    Unset means 0 meaning SME is off unless mem_encrypt=on in the kernel
    command line.

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_BOOT_ARGS



    OT_KERNEL_SSD - Set if SSD drive is present for this kernel build.

    Acceptable values:

      1 - yes, a non-rotational hard drive is present
      0 - no SSD exists
      auto - autodetect via sysfs (default)
      unset - auto

    See also:

      OT_KERNEL_HDD



    OT_KERNEL_SWAP - Enable or disable use of swap.

    Acceptable values:

      0, 1, y, n, manual, unset

    0 means disable and 1 means enable.  Unset is the same as manual.  

    Swap is forced disabled for the following work-profiles:

      casual-gaming
      casual-gaming-laptop

      workstation

    If you would like to increase the number of browser tabs, then swap should
    be enabled.  1.2 GiB for video tabs, 170 MiB per social media tabs.

    Memory intensive scenarios should always enable swap.  If you need swap use
    any work profile not mentioned in OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE with
    OT_KERNEL_SWAP=1.  It is assumed that have enough memory for professional
    production.  This is what is assumed:

    Casual games:  2-4 GiB
    Gaming on major titles:  4-8 GiB depending on the title
    Live stream gaming:  16-32 GiB (8 GiB for gaming + 4 GiB at 1080p)



    OT_KERNEL_TARGET_TRIPLE - The target triple (CHOST) to use when
    cross-compiling.  Use the expanded CHOST value.  (This can be not set but
    then defaults to ${CHOST}.)  If you put just CHOST or just CBUILD it will
    expand for each case.



    OT_KERNEL_TCP_CONGESTION_CONTROLS - Select TCP congestion controls to
    add.  A space separated list may be used.  The first option is the default.
    (EXPERIMENTAL)

    The goal of TCP congestion control (TCC) is to avoid the penalties
    associated with bad quality of service (longer delays or increased packet
    loss).

    Acceptable values:

      * bbr2, c2tcp, deepcc, hstcp, illinois, lp, nv, orca, pcc, scalable, yeah
        cannot be made the default.
      * deep, orca has not been tested in this overlay yet.
      * Throughput alone implies high throughput.
      * Latency alone implies low latency.
      * Incast is more than half drop in throughput but results from drop rate
        and percent may change based on RTT.

      * It is recommended to fix physical layer and application layers issues
        as best as possible because they can impact the effectiveness/benefits
        of these Contestion Control Algorithms (CCAs).
      * Tips to improve wired throughput:
        1. Inspect the wire both on the ends and in the middle.  If any
           cuts, dents, loosening, or stretching are observed; the wire needs to
           be replaced.
      * Tips to improve WiFi throughput:
        1. Turn off all programs except emerge or the affected app.
           [This step is necessary only if the protocol or action does not
           support resume (e.g. git clone) or an improperly configured server
           that frequently drops connections.]
        2. Ensure that the antennas are not damaged.  Screw or replace the
           antenna.
        3. Ensure that the wireless router is positioned visibly in the open
           area or room.  If the site in question has thick walls (aka
           reinforced concrete), switch to wired or place the router visibly in
           the line of sight of the WiFi receiver.  Remove metallic obstacles
           in the line of sight to increase strength.
        4. Move the wireless closer to increase signal strength to gain access
           to the faster 5G mode.
        5. Fix all dropped packet issues.  If networkmanager causes dropped
           packets, use netifrc instead.  This may help unmask other sources of
           dropped packets or possibly router issues such as overheating,
           antenna damage, compromised firmware, an active DDOS attack.
           As mentioned in the table above a tiny percentage of dropped
           packets may cause a severe performance impact.
        6. Orient the antenna to achieve the lowest ping consistently with the
           wireless router.
        7. Switch the TCP Congestion Control to one with the highest average
           throughput (e.g. pcc).  For lossy poor quality connections, avoid
           cubic and illinois. [This step is only necessary for protocols
           or actions not supporting resume (e.g. git clone) or an improperly
           configured server that frequently drops connections.]

    Examples:

      OT_KERNEL_TCP_CONGESTION_CONTROLS="clear"                              # Fallback to cubic and reno
      OT_KERNEL_TCP_CONGESTION_CONTROLS="bbr3 htcp hybla lp vegas westwood"  # Similar to fallback defaults
      OT_KERNEL_TCP_CONGESTION_CONTROLS="dctcp bbr3 illinois"                # Similar to HPC defaults

      For allowed defaults, see

        https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/net/ipv4/Kconfig#L682

      The left most choice is the default, and the values listed overrides the
      fallback values.

      The OT_KERNEL_TCP_CONGESTION_CONTROLS_SCRIPT_* can be used to select
      the secondary flow.  For example, one may need to increase the
      secondary flow to be more slightly greedy for a higher bitrate and to
      be less skippy.

      The default fallback will take into consideration OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE.

    Recommendations:

      Audio streaming:  bbr
      Big data HPC - dctcp

      * The left most value in OT_KERNEL_TCP_CONGESTION_CONTROLS makes it the default.
      * bbr means any version.
      * Use the tcca script to change these.
      * For frequent packet loss, it recommended to avoid cubic.

    OT_KERNEL_USE - Per build env USE flags.  If not set, it will use the same
    USE flags set.  The scope of OT_KERNEL_USE is partially in src_prepare,
    src_configure, src_compile, partially in src_install.  The normal USE flags
    are valid in global scope, fetching and unpacking, and in the remaining
    phases.  This per build env gives more control over some patches applied,
    features allowed, reducing the attack surface of unfuzzed patchsets by
    not applying them.



    OT_KERNEL_USE_LSM_UPSTREAM_ORDER - Use the upstream init order
    for LSM modules.
    Accepted values: 1 to use upstream order, 0 to use custom order.
    The custom order (0) can optionally apply to "acceptable multi values"
    configation and auto in acceptable general values.



    OT_KERNEL_VERBOSITY=N (optional) - presentation of compiler and build
    invocation.  This will print out the compiler flags used during 
    compilation.  Using 1 will print as if you are compiling a typical ebuild
    package.

    Acceptable values for N:

      0 for minimal output, 1 for showing compiler flags, 2 for reasons for
      rebuild.

    Tags:  verbose, console, stderr, compiler output, cflags, command line output



    OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE - sets the power-performance profile while taking
    in consideration productivity and latency requirements.  This value can
    be unset which is equivalent to manual.

    Notes:

      - Some profiles are conveniently aliases.
      - builder* are used for emerging.
      - The OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE is disjoint from OT_KERNEL_HARDENING_LEVEL to
        provide flexibility.
      - You can only use one OT_KERNEL_WORK_PROFILE per profile/extraversion.
      - It's recommended to have a separate profile/extraversion per profile.
      - digital-audio-workstation and PREEMPT_RT=y disables swap, it is
        recommended to build a builder kernel with swap enabled to build the
        entire userland.

    OT_KERNEL_ZSWAP_ALLOCATOR - chooses the swap allocator which tries to fit
    the number of compressed pages while aiming to reduce fragmentation.

    Acceptable values:

      zsmalloc, zbud, z3fold, x2, x3, xn, unset, manual, auto

    If unset, it assumes manual.  xn is an alias for zsmalloc; x2 is a alias
    for zbud; x3 is an alias for z3fold.  auto is an alias for zszmalloc.  It is
    recommended to use xn for less than 12 GB of RAM.  For 12 GB and above, it
    should be unset.  The 12 GB is arbitrary and based on worst case peak
    memory.



    OT_KERNEL_ZSWAP_COMPRESSOR - chooses a swap page algorithm

    Acceptable values:

      deflate, lzo, 842, lz4, lz4hc, zstd, unset, manual, auto

    If unset, it assumes manual.  auto is an alias for lzo.  It is recommended
    to use lz4 or zstd (or any algorithm that can achieve 2:1 compression
    ratio) for less than 12 GB of ram.  For 12 GB and above, it should be unset.
    The 12 GB is arbitrary and based on worst case peak memory.



    Kernel pkgflags environment variables:

    The pkgflags come mostly from the ebuilds' themselves.  The current
    trend is to decentralize these settings and have users to manually
    edit the kernel.  This ebuild package will do the opposite by
    centralizing these settings for purposes of a semi autoconfigured
    kernel.

    By default kernel pkgflags module is not enabled.  To enable it, set
    OT_KERNEL_AUTO_CONFIGURE_KERNEL_FOR_PKGS=1 in the per buildconfig env
    file (ex. /etc/portage/ot-sources/4.16/ot/x86_64/env).

    One may reject or accept kernel settings by setting
    OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_ACCEPT or OT_KERNEL_PKGFLAGS_REJECT with a space
    separated 7 digit id.  One may use the reject to manually apply
    settings for that package.

    Most variables below have values 0 for off and 1 for on.  Not set implies
    the eclass defaults.



    Pkgflags environment variables

    These should be specified in the per buildconfig env file.  These
    environment variables are only valid if the package is installed.
    0 means off and 1 means on.

    Important:  The 0 does not imply disable but implies unchanged in some
    cases.  This is because of the possibility of *flag dependencies* which are
    difficult to backtrack.  You must manually disable them by editing the
    kernel config.  This understanding is applied to previous sections as
    well.  The application of intuitive implied disable or implied unchange
    is based on the following general rules:  If it seems like the kernel
    option could be multiple referenced, a base option for an another option,
    or library option; it is implied unchanged.  If it seems like the kernel
    option is unlikely a base option, unlikely inherited option, or unlikely
    multiple reference, or is likely independent; it is likely an implied
    disabled.

    AMDGPU_DEEP_COLOR - Add support for more than 8 Bits Per Pixel for utilities
    querying capabilities.  For HDMI connections, it may be beneficial to set to
    1.  0 is the upstream default.
    Valid values:  0 (default), 1

    AMDGPU_DIRECT_DMA_FOR_SSG - Enable Direct DMA for SSG.  This requires the
    rock-dkms USE flag.
    Valid values:  0 (default), 1

    AMDGPU_EXP_HW_SUPPORT - Enable kernel driver support for experimental hardware.
    Valid values:  0 (default), 1
    This setting affects the following kernels and devices under these codenames:

      For the basic kernel driver:

        Kernel 5.4 for Arcturus, Renoir, Navi 12

      For the rock-dkms kernel driver:

        Does not apply or fully supported

    AMDGPU_OVERDRIVE - Set the overdrive flag (aka overclocking flag) to allow
    to set GPU clocks via the sysfs interface for the amdgpu driver.  This flag
    may also allow to control voltage.  This will embed amdgpu.ppfeaturemask in
    the kernel cmdline.  0 means disable the overclock bit, 1 is to enable the
    overclock bit.  Unset means to manually customize it.  If you already set
    amdgpu.ppfeaturemask, leave it unset.  The estimated benefit is between
    maybe 1-5 FPS with risk of temporary to permanent instability (e.g.
    freezing), or permanent damage (aka artifacts or bricking).  It should only
    be used as a last resort.  Vsync off or monitor hz changes should be used
    first.
    !!! EXPERTS ONLY !!!
    CHANGING THE CLOCK FREQUENCY MAY CAUSE DAMAGE AND VOID
    HARDWARE WARRANTY.  SETTING CLOCKS TOO HIGH OR HAVING INADEQUATE COOLING MAY
    CAUSE IRREVERSABLE DAMAGE.  SETTING THE VOLTAGE JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH CAN
    CAUSE DAMAGE OR VISUAL ARTIFIACTS.  RESET BACK SETTINGS IF VISUAL ARTIFACTS
    ENCOUNTERED.  TOO MUCH HEAT WILL SHORTEN THE LIFESPAN OF THE DEVICE.
    THIS ECLASS VARIABLE IS EXPERIMENTAL.

    X86_MICROARCH_OVERRIDE - Override the -march=native or -march=generic.  With
    the help of the kernel_compiler_patch, more march values are exposed based
    on compiler support.  Setting to a specific microarchitecture is useful for
    prebuilt kernel packages.  For the greatest portablility, use GENERIC_CPU.
    For autodetection, use a MNATIVE* option.  However, the MNATIVE* option
    only works when the builder machine (CBUILD) is the same as the target
    or host machine (CTARGET/CHOST) to run the kernel.  The environment variable
    only valid in x86 and x86_64.  STATUS:  This setting may be removed in the
    future.

    If unset, it will use a MNATIVE* or GENERIC_CPU matching the
    march equivalent.  The MNATIVE* name changes depending if you are using
    the 4.14 series.

    The custom or manual value is provided to use previously set values.

    The availability of some options or spelling below may depend on
    the version of the compiler and the version of the kernel_compiler_patch.
    See arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu for details.  It is not necessary to use the
    kernel_compiler_patch, but this environment variable also works with
    the vanilla unpatch set.

      Changes existing TCP congestion controls for C2TCP with ultra low latency
      with benefits of low jitter and lower delays.

      The architecture of C2TCP is AQM inspired.  It essentially overrides
      control window based on bad conditions, with desired target delays
      set by the application.

      The architecture assumes that it is plugged into a loss based
      congestion control algorithm.

      Orca is an AI architecture that is partially AI driven and

      It is a learning based TCP congestion control using Deep Renforced
      Learning (DRL w/TD3) and Finite State Machine (FSM) based Congestion

      convergance toward high throughput, lower delays, and lower loss;
      better unseen performance; lower CPU usage than pure learning
      implementations.
      
      The output of orca is changes in control window (cwnd) and pacing rates.
