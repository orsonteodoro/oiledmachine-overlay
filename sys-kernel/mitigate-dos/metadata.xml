  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  This ebuild currently is focused on mitigation of CPU hardware vulnerabilties
  focused on DoS mitigation.

  A parent ebuild may be considered to verify larger mitigation coverage.

  <use>
    <flag name="auto">
      Auto resolves firmware and kernel version required for full mitigation,
      instead of manually selecting microarchitecture which determines the
      minimum requirements for those 2 items.
    </flag>
    <flag name="custom-kernel">
      Prevent vendor lock-in when doing kernel mitigation checks.
    </flag>
    <flag name="firmware">
      Use firmware as mitigation.
      (A BIOS firmware update from the motherboard manufacturer may still be
      required if the firmware package doesn't apply to your model.)
    </flag>
    <flag name="mlx5">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service in mlx5 kernel drivers.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_amdgpu">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service.
