  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  This ebuild is for enforcement of Denial of Service (DoS) mitigations on
  a broader scope.  It was previously focused and still continues to support
  mitigation of DoS based CPU hardware vulnerabilties.  The ebuild will
  support client-side DoS mitigation or server-side DoS mitigation.

  At this time, the ebuild-package is optional and ebuilds do not require it
  in this overlay.  Admins may emerge this ebuild directly.

  A parent ebuild may be considered to verify larger mitigation coverage.


  Build time environment variables:

  CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM - Name of the kernel you want to add to take advantage
  of automatic RDEPEND updates instead of manually updating/removing kernel
  packages.  If you set this, then disable USE=custom-kernel.  Multiple
  kernel packages may be specified.

  Example:

    CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM="sys-kernel/ot-sources sys-kernel/xanmod-kernel"

  FIRMWARE_VENDOR - Name of the CPU manufacturer for the kernel.  It should be
  set for cross compile builds since the builder CPU manufacturer could be
  different.

      This is recommended for Intel® CPUs since the USE flag coverage for
      microarchitectures is incomplete.
