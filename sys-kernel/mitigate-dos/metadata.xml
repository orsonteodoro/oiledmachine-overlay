  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  This ebuild is for enforcement of Denial of Service (DoS) mitigations on
  a broader scope.  It was previously focused and still continues to support
  mitigation of DoS based CPU hardware vulnerabilties.  The ebuild will
  support client-side DoS mitigation or server-side DoS mitigation.

  At this time, the ebuild-package is optional and ebuilds do not require it
  in this overlay.

  A parent ebuild may be considered to verify larger mitigation coverage.


  Build time environment variables:

  CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM - Name of the kernel you want to add to take advantage
  of automatic RDEPEND updates instead of manually updating/removing kernel
  packages.  If you set this, then disable USE=custom-kernel.  Multiple
  kernel packages may be specified.

  Example:

    CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM="sys-kernel/ot-sources sys-kernel/xanmod-kernel"

  -->
  <use>
    <flag name="auto">
      Auto resolves firmware and kernel version required for full mitigation,
      instead of manually selecting microarchitecture which determines the
      minimum requirements for those 2 items which benefits mostly LTS
      configurations.

      This is recommended for IntelÂ® CPUs since the USE flag coverage for
      microarchitectures is incomplete.
    </flag>
    <flag name="custom-kernel">
      Prevent vendor lock-in when doing kernel mitigation checks.
    </flag>
    <flag name="firmware">
      Use firmware as mitigation.
      (A BIOS firmware update from the motherboard manufacturer may still be
      required if the firmware package doesn't apply to your model.)
    </flag>
    <flag name="mlx5">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service in mlx5 kernel drivers.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_amdgpu">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_intel">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_nouveau">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_nvidia">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_vmware">
      Mitigate against Denial of Service.
    </flag>
    <flag name="zero-tolerance">
      Bump to patched point releases when the changelog indicated fixed
      DoS class of vulnerabilities.  This will increase the coverage
      of DoS mitigation for the installed kernels significantly because
      the USE flag coverage is incomplete.
