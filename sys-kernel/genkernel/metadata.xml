    This is an ebuild fork that applies subdir_mount, crypt_root_plain, llvm
    PGO patches.

    Patch status:
    3.5.x.x - subdir_mount (works), crypt_root_plain (works)
    4.0.x - subdir_mount (untested), crypt_root_plain (works), llvm (works)
    4.2.x - subdir_mount (untested), crypt_root_plain (works), llvm (works),
      pgo (In development / WIP)

    When switching between 4.2.x and older versions, The /dev/disk/by-id/
    entries may change.  This means that you need to adjust the kernel
    parameters to the correct identifiers.

    Some PGO trainers require you run them in a desktop environment.

    If we used automation, we could possibly reduce steps 2-4 within
    about 90 minutes.

    Estimated time to build:

    30 min to build the instrumented kernel.
    30 min to run training to generate a profile.
    30 min to build the optimized kernel.

    PGO support requires a PGO toolchain to run benchmarks.  All benchmarks
    are done on a live system to make it more accessible without getting
    too technical.

    The performance of the instrumented build to the normal build is not
    dramatically slower and about the same perceptual performance as
    the normal build, but it does have a slightly have a few bugs
    present compared to a normal build compared to the instrumented.

    Phase 1 and 2 have been tested and currently trying to close
    compatibility issues with the profraw to profdata merger and
    debug phase 3.

    The following steps must be take for a PGO kernel:

    (1) Emerge a source based kernel package
    (2) Run genkernel --pgi all
    (3) Reboot
    (4) Run genkernel --pgt-all train
    (4 optional) Run genkernel --pgt-yt train in X as a normal user
    (5) Run genkernel --pgo all
    (6) Reboot

    The trainers that you choose should reflect typical use.  You may also
    extend PGO with your own custom script.

    Due to licensing concerns for the 2014 PGO GCC patch and associated scripts
    cannot be integrated both in the kernel sources and this package
    directly.  Only the emerging 2021 PGO with Clang patchset will be
    supported.

    Environmental variables (store in /etc/genkernel.conf):

    PGO_P2P_URI - The URI must have a filename to replace the placeholder
                  torrent.  (Only public domain assets or open source project
                  torrents should be used.)

    PGO_LINUX_TARBALL - Abspath to a linux tarball use as a source of
                  pseudo randomness.
