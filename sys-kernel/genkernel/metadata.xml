    This is an ebuild fork that applies subdir_mount, crypt_root_plain, CFI,
    Clang PGO support patches.

    Patch status:
    3.5.x.x - subdir_mount (works), crypt_root_plain (works)
    4.0.x - subdir_mount (untested), crypt_root_plain (works), llvm (works)
    4.2.x - subdir_mount (untested), crypt_root_plain (works), llvm (works),
      pgo (done, but may expand for a few more benchmarks.  Testing
      was not done yet to confirm that there was a performance gain before
      and after.),  cfi (builds sucessfully, but needs testing of it
      actually working)

    When switching between 4.2.x and older versions, The /dev/disk/by-id/
    entries may change.  This means that you need to adjust the kernel
    parameters to the correct identifiers.

    CFI support is limited to arm64 and x86_64 at this time.  arm64 is
    upstreamed completely, but x86_64 CFI support is currently in
    development/testing and requires manual patching.  The reference
    section below contains links to the x86_64 patches and how to add them
    as a per-package user patch, or you can wait until they are merged
    mainline.

    Some PGO trainers require you run them in a desktop environment.

    If we used automation, we could possibly reduce steps 2-4 within
    about 90 minutes.

    Estimated time to build:

    30 min to build the instrumented kernel.
    30 min to run training to generate a profile.
    30 min to build the optimized kernel.

    PGO support requires a PGO toolchain to run benchmarks.  All benchmarks
    are done on a live system to make it more accessible without getting
    too technical.

    The following steps must be take for a PGO kernel:

    (1) Emerge a source based kernel package >= 5.13 with applied PGO and profraw compat patches
        (See references section below for how to obtain and apply patches)
    (2) Run genkernel --pgi all
    (3) Reboot
    (4) Run genkernel --pgt-all train
    (optional) Run genkernel --pgt-yt train in X as a normal user
    (5) Run genkernel --pgo all
    (6) Reboot

    The trainers that you choose should reflect typical use.  You may also
    extend PGO with your own custom script.  The script should be placed
    in /usr/share/genkernel as pgo-custom.sh in the same folder as gen_pgo.sh
    with 0770 permissions with wheel to both user or group ownership.

    Due to licensing concerns for the 2014 PGO GCC patch and associated scripts
    cannot be integrated both in the kernel sources and this package
    directly.  Only the 2021 Clang PGO patchset will be supported.

    Environment variables:

      Store them in /etc/genkernel.conf or wrapper script.
      
      PGO_P2P_URI - The URI must have a filename to replace the placeholder
                    torrent.  (Only public domain assets or open source project
                    torrents should be used.)

      PGO_TRAINER_NETWORK_TCP_CONGESTIONS - string separated list from
        /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_allowed_congestion_control to select for
        PGO training.

      PGO_FILESYSTEMS_LIST - a string separated list of selected
        quintuples in this format to PGO train:

          ioscheduler_name&fs_name&dev_name&mount_point&test_dir

        * io_scheduler_name must be one of the names listed in
          `cat $(find /sys/devices/ -path "*sda*scheduler")`, where sda is
          replaced with the block device of interest.  It will be used to switch
          to that scheduler.
        * fs_name must match the driver name.  These are listed in
          ${KERNEL_DIR}/fs as one the subdirectories.
        * dev_name must the basename to the corresponding path listed in
          find /sys/ -name "scheduler".
        * mount_point must be abspath to the mount point.  It must not contain
          a space in the abspath.
        * test_dir must be a decent size folder like similar to /usr/bin that
          is used for grep tests and sequential read tests.  It also is
          an abspath relative to mount_point.  Read only tests are only
          performed in this directory.

        Example:
        PGO_FILESYSTEMS_LIST="bfq&ext4&sda&/&/usr/bin kyber&bfs&sdb&/mnt/foo&/data mq-deadline&ext4&sda&/&/usr/bin"

        If it is not set, it will default to the following:
        PGO_FILESYSTEMS_LIST="unk&unk&unk&/&/usr/bin"

      PGO_TRAINER_YT_URI - a custom URI to a video.  By default it
      will show a sample of the 2021 USA inauguration.
