  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  This ebuild currently is focused on mitigation of CPU hardware vulnerabilties
  focused on data theft mitigation and may also include data leak mitigation.
  It also verifies for some vulnerabilies that the mitigation has been applied.
  
  It was created as a reaction to cryptocurrency thefts for users of the distro.

  A different ebuild may be considered to verify mitigation against
  denial of services for mission critical servers.

  A parent ebuild may be considered to verify larger mitigation coverage
  against data theft to verify that X sandboxes and LSM are installed.


  Build time environment variables:

  CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM - Name of the kernel you want to add to take advantage
  of automatic RDEPEND updates instead of manually updating/removing kernel
  packages.  If you set this, then disable USE=custom-kernel.  Multiple
  kernel packages may be specified.

  Example:

    CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM="sys-kernel/ot-sources sys-kernel/xanmod-kernel"

  FIRMWARE_VENDOR - Name of the CPU manufacturer for the kernel.  It should be
  set for cross compile builds since the builder CPU manufacturer could be
  different.

  <use>
    <flag name="auto">
      Auto resolves firmware and kernel version required for full mitigation,
      instead of manually selecting microarchitecture which determines the
      minimum requirements for those 2 items which benefits mostly LTS
      configurations.

      This is recommended for IntelÂ® CPUs since the USE flag coverage for
      microarchitectures is incomplete.
    </flag>
    <flag name="bpf">
      Apply BPF mitigations for Spectre (Variant 2) or Spectre-NG.
    </flag>
    <flag name="custom-kernel">
      Prevent vendor lock-in when doing kernel mitigation checks.
    </flag>
    <flag name="firmware">
      Use firmware as mitigation.
      (A BIOS firmware update from the motherboard manufacturer may still be
      required if the firmware package doesn't apply to your model.)

    <flag name="mlx5">
      Mitigate against information disclosure.

    <flag name="video_cards_nouveau">

    <flag name="video_cards_nvidia">
      Mitigate against information disclosure, privelege escalation, Spectre V1,
      Spectre V2.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video_cards_vmware">
      Mitigate against information disclosure.
    </flag>
    <flag name="zero-tolerance">
      Bump to the latest patched kernel point releases when the changelog
      indicated fixed information disclosure (ID) class of vulnerabilities.
      This will increase the coverage of DoS mitigation for the installed
      kernels significantly because the USE flag coverage is incomplete.
