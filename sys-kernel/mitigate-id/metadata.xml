  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  This ebuild currently is focused on mitigation of CPU hardware vulnerabilties
  focused on data theft mitigation and may also include data leak mitigation.
  It also verifies for some vulnerabilies that the mitigation has been applied.
  
  It was created as a reaction to cryptocurrency thefts for users of the distro.

  A parent ebuild may be considered to verify larger mitigation coverage
  against data theft to verify that X sandboxes and LSM are installed.

  The optional sys-kernel/mitigate-dos can be used to verify mitigation against
  denial of services for mission critical servers.

  Build time environment variables:

  CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM - Name of the kernel you want to add to take advantage
  of automatic RDEPEND updates instead of manually updating/removing kernel
  packages.  If you set this, then disable USE=custom-kernel.  Multiple
  kernel packages may be specified.

  Example:

    CUSTOM_KERNEL_ATOM="sys-kernel/ot-sources sys-kernel/xanmod-kernel"

  FIRMWARE_VENDOR - Name of the CPU manufacturer for the kernel.  It should be
  set for cross compile builds since the builder CPU manufacturer could be
  different.

    <flag name="aacraid">
      Mitigate against information disclosure for the AAC RAID driver.

    <flag name="aead">
      Mitigate against information disclosure for the AEAD crypto driver.

    <flag name="auto">
      Auto resolves firmware and kernel version required for full mitigation,
      instead of manually selecting microarchitecture which determines the
      minimum requirements for those 2 items which benefits mostly LTS
      configurations.

      This is recommended for Intel® CPUs since the USE flag coverage for
      microarchitectures is incomplete.

      or the vulnerability report doesn't clearly state the types of
      vulnerabilities.
