  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  Environment variables:

  BPF_SPECTRE_V2_FAUSTIAN_BARGAIN - This concerns a Faustian bargan whether or
  not to enable BPF JIT when BPF is enabled.  Enabling JIT will mitigate against
  Spectre (Variant 2) but decreases security with JIT spray attack, which
  circumvents ASLR.  Disabling JIT will prevent the circumvention of ASLR.
  Faust allows you to use BPF but the price of this bargain that you must choose
  a negative.

  This bargain can be avoided by disabling BPF in the kernel.

  Valid values

    interpreter - Use the interpreter for BPF (the kernel default).
    jit         - Use JIT for BPF.

  <use>
    <flag name="auto">
      Auto resolves firmware and kernel version required for full mitigation,
      instead of manually selecting microarchitecture which determines the
      minimum requirements for those 2 items.
    </flag>
    <flag name="bpf">
      Apply bpf mitigations for Spectre (Variant 2) or Spectre-NG.
    </flag>
    <flag name="custom-kernel">
      Prevent vendor lock-in when doing kernel mitigation checks.
    </flag>
    <flag name="firmware">
      Use firmware as mitigation.
      (A BIOS firmware update from the motherboard manufacturer may still be
      required if the firmware package doesn't apply to your model.)
