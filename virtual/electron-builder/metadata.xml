    This metapackage is used to force updates of packages that use
    electron-builder or electron-packager so they pick up security updates for
    the Chromium parts.  Ebuilds that wish to update should add one of the
    following corresponding to the officially supported branch(es):

    virtual/electron-builder:16=    # alpha, corresponding to Chromium beta
    virtual/electron-builder:15=    # stable, corresponding Chromium EOL
    virtual/electron-builder:14=    # stable, corresponding Chromium EOL
    virtual/electron-builder:13=    # stable, corresponding Chromium EOL

    Slots 13-15 are NOT RECOMMENDED for web based Electron apps or apps that
    consume assets or documents from outside the organization or personal domain
    and may likely contain vulnerabilities in the EOL Chromium parts.

    These versions are listed in:
    https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#currently-supported-versions

    If autoupdate hasn't been done at the eclass level, ebuilds may choose to
    manually force update to the matching slot with the corresponding Electron
    release using best_version and electron-app_src_compile_electron_packager or
    electron-app_src_compile_electron_builder calls in the electron-app.eclass.
