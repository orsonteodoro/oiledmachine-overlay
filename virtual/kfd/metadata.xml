    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    The amdgpu-drm is a virtual ebuild.   It was originally intended as a way
    to choose either between the amdgpu driver in the rock-dkms package or the
    amdgpu driver provided by the kernel package.[1]

    Historically, it used the DC_VER from the rock-dkms package as a way to
    ensure correspondence and equivalence between the ROCm version and DC_VER in
    both the vanilla kernel and the ROCK-Kernel-Driver.  The flaw in the
    assumption has been corrected.

    To find the vanilla kernel equivalent, we see the most recent last commits of

      https://github.com/ROCm/ROCK-Kernel-Driver/commits/rocm-@ROCM_VERSION@/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd

    are present in the vanilla kernel.
