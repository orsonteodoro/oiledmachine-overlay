The LIBC support below reflects the upstream projects CI (Continuous

* Using 32-bit may increase the chances of high-critical vulnerabilities.  Examples:
  - ASLR effectiveness on 32-bit is estimated to be 10-20% or 20-50% and can lead to increased privilege escalation, data tampering, information disclosure
  - Transient execution CPU vulnerabilities (Meltdown, Spectre v2, MDS, TAA, SCSB, FPVI, BHI, Retbleed) may lead to information disclosure if unpatched or partially patched for 32-bit
  - V8 Sandbox (64-bit supported only, protects against memory corruption, if not used may lead to code execution, privilege escalation, data tampering, information disclosure)

* The LTS compilers (C++ 17 or older) for LTS packages correspond to
  gcc_slot_11_5, gcc_slot_12_5, gcc_slot_13_4, gcc_slot_14_3, llvm_slot_18,
  llvm_slot_19, llvm_slot_20 USE flags.
* The rolling compilers (C++ 20 or newer) for bleeding edge packages
  correspond to gcc_slot_15_2, gcc_slot_16_1, llvm_slot_21, llvm_slot_22, a
  non-exaustive list of USE flags.
* LTS compilers have the libstdc++ GLIBCXX_ versioned symbols, GPU stack
  compatibility, practically complete version of the C++ standard on both the
  *C++ compiler* and *C++ standard library*, and ensure that the userland is
  built for compatibility for C++ prebuilt LTS binaries.  Currently, C++ 17 is
  the default for both GCC and Clang and is the default for most open source
  C++ projects in 2025.  A LTS compiler should be used as the systemwide
  default to maximize performance and compatibility.
* The rolling compilers have the up-to-date implementation of the edition of the
  C++ standard,  increased feature coverage for the edition of the standard,
  usually have the minimum required feature set to build most projects for that
  standard on this overlay.  The minimum GCC/Clang version used per rolling
  standard in this overlay minimizes incomplete coverage to avoid missing
  support errors.  The consequences of using the rolling compiler as the
  systemwide default is that it will lock out access for GPU acceleration which
  is orders of magnitude faster than CPU in certain use case scenarios.
* Ebuild testing and development defaults on this overlay are currently
  set to GCC 13, GCC 15, Clang 18, Clang 19, Python 3.11.
* CUDA 11.8 is not recommended because of version inconsistency between
  distro's cuDNN ebuild and pyTorch version recommendations.  This CUDA version
  is limited to using GCC 11 only on this overlay.
* GCC 12 or 13 are recommended for CUDA 12.8 for maximum compatibility coverage
  for using Blender, Ollama (LLM), pyTorch (ML) and to closely align with D12
  or U24.
* GCC 13 is recommended for ROCm 6.4 for maximum compatibility coverage for
  example with pyTorch (ML), TensorFlow (ML), Ollama (LLM), Blender and to
  closely align with U24.
* GCC 15 is not supported as a LTS compiler because it breaks -fvtable-verify,
  which lowers security.  GCC 15 is supported as a rolling compiler for non
  LTS (C++ 20 or newer) packages (e.g. Hyprland).
* GCC is preferred but Clang is recommended as the fallback compiler.
* Clang 18, 19, 20, 21 are alternative LTS compilers on this overlay, but the
  corresponding libc++ 21 is still feature incomplete and not recommended as
  the default.
* libstdc++ is the assumed default C++ standard library in this overlay.
  The alternative libc++ as a systemwide default has not been tested for
  these ebuilds.
* Vendored Clang `21.0.0git` and vendored Rust (`<rust-ver>-dev`) from the
  chromium-toolchain package are only supported on Chromium for proper Rust SSP.
* rust-bin 9999 is recommended for SSP, sanitizers, and as default to be used in
  security-critical packages.
* rust-bin older supported stable (1.74.0, 1.75.0) and rust-bin latest stable
  (1.86.0) are recommended as fallbacks for non security-critical packages.

* [2] Via llvm-roc-libomp
* [3] Multislotted on this overlay.  Multiple versions can be installed at the same time.
* [4] Backporting security patches is likely to be incomplete.  No hardened
      ebuilds will be provided.  You must either keep a local ebuild fork
      with cflags-hardened changes or add per-package hardening CFLAGS (e.g.
      Retpoline, CET) for UI toolkit packages that have a password UI widget,
      or for packages that process untrusted data or process sensitive data.
* [5] No extra libstdc++ versioned symbol consistency verification via
      `gcc_slot_<x>`.  You are responsible for ensuring the default GCC is set
      to the proper default when building Qt5 packages to avoid linking issues.
      Manually set the default LTS compiler for C++ 17 and older C++ projects.
      Manually set the default rolling compiler for C++ 20 and newer C++ projects.
      If no C++ standard stated, assume LTS.  The Qt5 based project will state
      in the build files either `-std=c++<ver>` or `-std=gnu++<ver>` or
      `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`.
* Due to the lack of GPU access, the requirements are the exact major.minor
  version requirements for GPU, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Model
  (LLM) ebuild packages in this overlay for increased chances of
  reproducibility.

Gentoo Prefix is not supported and deprecated on this overlay.

The support status depends on the ebuild contributors ability to test and patch.
