  oiledmachine-overlay notes:

  This ebuild package allows the package to be optimized with PGO/BOLT for
  purposes of speeding up compilation time.


  Prerequisites:

  It is assumed that the dependencies are already installed for that slot.
  You may use the -o emerge flag to add just the dependencies.



  Add to /etc/portage/env/llvm-roc.conf:

  LLVM_ROC_TRAINERS="rocPRIM rocRAND rocSPARSE"
  #ROCM_OVERLAY_DIR="/usr/local/oiledmachine-overlay" # if using older README.md instructions
  ROCM_OVERLAY_DIR="/var/db/repos/oiledmachine-overlay" # if overlay was added through eselect repository


  To get PGO working, add run each slotted opt.sh script as follows:

  LLVM_ROC_PHASES="PGI PGT PGO" \
  ROCM_SLOTS="5.7" \
  ./optimize.sh

  # Alternatively,
  LLVM_ROC_PHASES="PGI PGT PGO BGI BGT BGO" \
  ROCM_SLOTS="5.7" \
  ./optimize.sh


  Environment variables:

  LLVM_ROC_ENV_PATH - path to the env config.  "/etc/portage/env/llvm-roc.conf" (default)
  LLVM_ROC_TRAINERS - A space separated list of packages to build.  Acceptable values:  composable_kernel, rocBLAS, rocMLIR, rocPRIM, rocRAND, rocSPARSE
  LLVM_ROC_WIPE_PGO_PROFILES - 1 to delete all PGO/BOLT profiles,  0 to used cached PGO profile.
  LLVM_SLOTS - A space separated list of slots to build.  "5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7" (default)
  LLVM_ROC_PHASES - A space separated list of PGO/BOLT phases to add or remove, allowing to skip if previous steps performed.  "PGI PGT PGO" (default)  Acceptable values:  PGI PGT PGO BGI BGT BGO


  Training time cost:

  composable_kernel:  high
  rocBLAS:  high
  rocMLIR:  medium
  rocRAND:  low
  rocSPARSE:  medium
  rocPRIM:  low


  Training purpose:

  composable_kernel:  GPU compile for PGO profile generation
  rocBLAS:  GPU compile for PGO profile generation
  rocMLIR:  CPU based compilation for PGO profile generation
  rocRAND:  GPU compile for PGO profile generation
  rocSPARSE:  GPU compile for PGO profile generation
  rocPRIM:  GPU compile for PGO profile generation


  PGO post install instructions:

  When starting the ./optimize.sh, the epgo and ebolt USE flags should be
  removed from package.use.  The script will override it.

  After the process is done, you should set both epgo and ebolt in package.use.

  -->
  <use>
    <flag name="bolt">
      Build support for BOLT (Binary Optimization and Layout Tool) for post
      build optimization that has a workflow similar to PGO.
    </flag>
    <flag name="epgo">
      Build an optimized Clang toolchain using Profile Guided Optimization (PGO)
      to decrease build times by maybe 20%.
    </flag>
    <flag name="ebolt">
      Build an optimized build using BOLT (Binary Optimization and Layout Tool)
      to improve CPU caching and branch prediction using execution sampling data
      used to optimize code layout.  This may improve performance by 15%.  It
      provides additional post build optimizations. (EXPERIMENTAL)
    </flag>
