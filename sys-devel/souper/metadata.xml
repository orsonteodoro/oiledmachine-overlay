    Souper is an LLVM IR optimizer pass that can reduce a binary by around 4.4%
    but with a 2% runtime performance slowdown tradeoff.[1]

    It automatically generates random code sequences of optimized code
    sequences.  Because of this random code generation, two additional CFLAGS
    can be used as input to additional functions when computing the cost.


    Ricer notes:

    Two profile options can improve optimization over time but require the redis
    USE flag.

    Extra CFLAGS

     * -souper-static-profile -- can be used to add performance counters for
          size
     * -souper-dynamic-profile -- can be used to add performance counters for
          execution speed

    The above settings correspond to sclang front-end ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES as
    well:

      *  SOUPER_STATIC_PROFILE
      *  SOUPER_DYNAMIC_PROFILE


    Fontend wrappers:

    sclang can be used in place of clang when setting CC environment variable.

    sclang++ can be used in place of clang++ when setting CXX environment
    variable.

      Use the Redis DB as an external query cache to reduce time cost
      of looking up the most frequent encountered code sequences mapped to
      the to cheapest code sequence while skipping steps to obtain it.

      Note the use of redis can increase the cost of RAM in the order
      of 100s of MB but the time savings is amortized (meaning high
      initial cost but decreased over time).  Without redis the time cost
      could be 6.28-13x times larger in the initial compilation
      relative to warm cache runs.

      It is recommended to hardmask newer versions of Redis in package.mask.
