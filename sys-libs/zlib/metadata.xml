    This ebuild fork introduces PGO.

    PGO instructions
    (1) emerge the zlib ebuild without pgo USE flag
    (2) emerge pigz
    (3) emerge with pgo USE flag and at least one trainer USE flag.
        For web, the default compression levels are recommended.  Also,
        consider 8 and max for image compression if using png, which
        are often used on the web.

    The pgo-custom USE flag can be extended for your particular
    typical use pattern.  For example, you may add a custom script
    to optimize for web use.  You will need to supply your own
    custom per-package user patch and it must be placed in ${S}.

    You may set the following per-package envvars:

    MINIZIP_PGO_SHORT_N_ITERATIONS=X, where X >= 1 will only affect the
    trainer-...-short, trainer-...-store,
    trainer-...-max-compression USE flags.  The default is 30.

    MINIZIP_PGO_LONG_N_ITERATIONS=X, where X >= 1 will only affect the
    trainer-...-long USE flags.  The default is 300.

    MINIZIP_PGO_MAX_FILES=N, where N >= 1 will limit the number of
    files to add to archived binary zip files.  The default is
    500.

    At least one
${PORTAGE_DISTDIR}/pgo/assets/{apng,bmp,gif,images,jpeg,png,svg,tiff,webp}
    folder is required for trainer-zlib-images USE flag.
    Image assets will not be provided but you may provide your own
    or obtain them from the web if they are marked public domain or
    permissive or license compatible.
