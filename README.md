# oiledmachine-overlay

## Important special note

Work on this repo may cease or be infrequent.  Please see issue request.

## About

This portage overlay contains various ebuilds for the Gentoo Linux
distribution.  It focuses on optimized ebuilds, some game development, 
software used in computer science courses, C#, Electron apps, and other legacy 
software and hardware support packages.

The name of the repo comes from "well-oiled machine."  A (Gentoo) computer 
should not feel like molasses under high memory pressure or heavy IO 
utilization.  It should run smoothly.

## Important stuff

## Overlay bugs/fixes/news

Overlay bugs and fixes are addressed with the `eselect news` command, a feature
that I almost never use.  This overlay uses this system to post
**_critical bugs and fixes_** that cannot be simply fixed through automated means
but by required manual intervention.  You may read the full text by navigating
to the .txt file at:

* https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/tree/master/metadata/news

The selected first 5 news items:

* 2025-01-16 - [Rotate passwords immediately](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/metadata/news/2025-01-16-rotate-passwords/2025-01-16-rotate-passwords.txt)

## Licenses

Many of these packages have special licenses and EULAs attached to them.  I 
recommend that you edit your /etc/portage/make.conf so it looks like this 
ACCEPT_LICENSE="-*" and manually accept each of the licenses.

Licenses can be found in the following locations:

* [The distro overlay license folder](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/licenses)
* [The oiledmachine-overlay license folder](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/tree/master/licenses)

It is assumed that the distro license folders exists on the local system.

The copyright notices are contained in the source code of downloaded
tarballs and in the about section of the program.

The identifier `custom` is recognized by this overlay and used in several
Linux distros in their community package sets with their LICENSE variable.
It is a catch all used when no license template contains the exact phase
or clause.  The ebuild will contain the keywords to find the custom license.
You can use repo search feature in that project to find the license file
and the location of the text before emerging the package.  You may try to
find the text in the monolithic license file (a file containing all the
licenses and copyright notices) referenced in the LICENSE variable.  If
the license text is buried in a git submodule, you need to manually scan
each module or try to do a search engine scan.  You can also try to do the
following in the command line template:

```
#OILEDMACHINE_OVERLAY_ROOT=${OILEDMACHINE_OVERLAY_ROOT:-"/usr/local/oiledmachine-overlay"} # if using the old README.md instructions
OILEDMACHINE_OVERLAY_ROOT=${OILEDMACHINE_OVERLAY_ROOT:-"/var/db/repos/oiledmachine-overlay"} # if using eselect repository
cd "${OILEDMACHINE_OVERLAY_ROOT}"
cd ${PN}
ebuild ${PN}-${PV}.ebuild unpack
grep -l -i -r -e "<KEYWORDS>" "<WORKDIR>"
```

to scan the package locally to find the license file before merge.

Many of these packages especially non-free software also require you to 
manually obtain the installer or files to install and may require you to 
register on their website.  The required files are listed in the ebuild but
may require some mental gynmanstics to find the actual name.

## Broken / Still in development

### Python

Several packages hard depend on Python 3.9 and will emit
"No supported implementation in PYTHON_COMPAT" because of the eager version
bump of this version which is not EOL until Oct 2025 by the Python language
developers but EOL on this distro.

You will need to uninstall these packages.

The maximum slot will not be auto bumped by scripts in this overlay anymore.

Python maximums for PYTHON_COMPAT in this overlay are upstream set listed
in python.py + proof of test (aka summary of the test result(s) passed)
which are listed in the footer of the ebuild as the standard in this
overlay.  This overlay may downgrade the PYTHON_COMPAT if no proof is
provided.

### .NET Framework stack or .NET Core stack

It was decided to keep these packages around; however, they are not tested
in actual programs.

Since there is no official distro package developer guide or eclass for
.NET 6.0+ packages, the install locations may be off for ebuilds in this
overlay.

## Legacy packages

Old packages can be found at 
[oiledmachine-overlay-legacy](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay-legacy).

A package may be moved to oiledmachine-overlay-legacy if bundled dependencies
are not fixed within several following discoveries of critical vulnerabilties
typically in several months.

A package also moves to legacy if the project is defunct.

A package does not move to legacy if a newer different package replacement is
found or same ebuild found in the gentoo-overlay.

A package does not move to legacy if the project's source code or possibly the
dependency's source code was deleted.

## Enhanced ebuild metadata.xml info

Some of the ebuilds in this repo contain improved comprehensive information
describing USE flags, developer API documentation info, or special per-package
environmental variables that improve the build process that can be found in
the metadata.xml, or obtainable through `epkginfo -x =games-engines/box2d-2.4.1-r2`
for example.  Some of that information is only obtained by inspecting the
comments of that file.  See `epkginfo --help` for details.

Additional troubleshooting details can also be found by inspecting the header
and footer of the ebuild.

## Ebuild quality

Most ebuilds in this ebuild are assumed production ready.

Disabled KEYWORDS has ambiguous meanings.  It can mean that it is either a live
ebuild, or is incomplete, etc.

### Markings for not production ready

To clarify which ebuilds are not production ready, this overlay has added to the
footer the following metainfo:

```
# OILEDMACHINE-OVERLAY-EBUILD-FINISHED:  NO
```

To see a list which ebuilds are not production ready, run the following at the
root of this overlay:
```
grep -l --exclude-dir=.git -r -e "OILEDMACHINE-OVERLAY-EBUILD-FINISHED:.*NO" ./
```

KEYWORDS does the same thing but it has different meanings over time.  It could
mean fresh install without problems or widely tested.

Production ready means that it simply installs and the package is working
acceptably without necessarily running test suites with minimal install
features or the arbitrary tested USE flag combination at that time.

But in this overlay, running test suites are optional but done so for mostly
library packages or packages that are rarely used with unknown runtime
correctness.  Many python packages in this overlay have been tested but for
other programming languages this has not been done.  In this overlay, it is
planned to prioritize PGO capable first, running test-suites for libraries
next, smaller/trivial packages next, then high MLOC packages over time.
This testing will be limited to only latest stable for dependencies.  This
overlay has fixed missing required USE flags and applied regressions fixes
as a result of running test suites.  These test suites are also inspected
for usefulness (e.g. a benchmark, demos, or similar real world tasks) in
PGO optimization on the ebuild level which some ebuilds exploit.

### Markings for test-suite testing or interactive testing

Test-suite testing is done randomly.  Tentative details can be found at the
footer of the ebuild:

For interactive testing, some most used functionality will be tested.

```
# OILEDMACHINE-OVERLAY-EBUILD-TESTED-VERSIONS:  1.2.1 1.2.1[python_targets_python3_10] commit-id
# OILEDMACHINE-OVERLAY-TEST:  PASS (INTERACTIVE) 113.0.1 (May 15, 2023)
```

## Security policy

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### 2025 policy

(Draft)

This overlay will force hardening always on to mitigate against some zero click
attacks.

These default hardening flags have an estimated worst case performance penalty
around 1.35 times the base performance without mitigation which is similar to
-O1 at -40% best case performance penalty relative to -O3 or -Ofast.

Packages are relatively adjusted for CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE so that in
packages can be properly secured mitigating repeating past mistakes.
ASan/HWASan/GWP-ASan will be required.  Packages with historical CVE reputation
of heap overflows or use after free will be ASan-ed.  Packages with historical
CVE reputation for integer overflows or bounds issues will get UBSan treatment.
The -fstack-protector does not mitigate heap overflow.

| CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE | Package security posture                  | Inherits cflag-hardened or rustflags-hardened eclass
| ----                      | ----                                      | ----
| 1.10 or less              | Performance-critical                      | No
| 1.11-1.50                 | Balanced                                  | Maybe
| 1.35                      | Balanced default to enable Retpoline      | Yes
| 1.80 or more              | Security-critical                         | Yes
| 4.0                       | Security-critical default to enable ASan  | Yes

How to interpret the above table:

- 1.0 means fully performance optimized as -Ofast/-O3 and unmitigated.
- 1.10 means performance-critical like -O2.
- 1.11 means 1.11 times slower than the base performance.  This is the best case balanced performance.
- 1.40 means like -O0 at its best case.
- 1.50 means 1.50 times slower than the base performance.  This is the worst case balanced performance.
- 1.51 to 1.79 means declining performance and additional decent mitigations may be applied.
- 4.0 means 4 times worst case slower than the base performance but enable expensive mitigations against critical severity vulnerabilities/exploits.
- Setting CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER means that you are accepting or managing
  the worst case performance as a result of hardening.
- The values are normalized float multiples relative to the base.
- In the above table, ASan means any ASan flavor (ASan, GWP-ASan, HWASan).
- The ASan/UBSan will be allowed if it passes the test suite or passes an
  interactive test.  The test suite has a higher precedence to decide
  if it should be disabled.

For packages marked sensitive-data, there are consideration of adding wrapper to
use a secure heap allocator (scudo, hardened_malloc, etc) for secure erase of
sensitive data from memory on dealloc.

Users can override the tolerance level by changing
CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER.  Details about what runtime mitigations will be
activated can be found at
[cflags-hardened.eclass](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/eclass/cflags-hardened.eclass#L123).

CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER and RUSTFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER mean the
same, but not necessary one affecting the other.

If a package is ASan-able, the *flags-hardened eclass will dedupe the
overlapping check to prevent double checking stack overflow.  If a package is
UBSan-able, it will dedupe the overlapping signed integer check to avoid double
checking signed overflow.

| Flag               | Heap overflow mitigation | Stack overflow mitigation |
| ----               | ----                     | ----                      |
| -fstack-protector  | No                       | Yes                       |
| -fsanitize=address | Yes                      | Yes                       |

Heap overflow is implied ranked higher than stack overflow for vulnerabilities
reported on the Top 25 list of vulnerabilities classes.  -fstack-protector*
is a pre-2014 mitigation.  For 2025, hardened allocators, sanitizers, MTE are
preferred for the security-critical perimeter.

| Flag                 | Signed integer overflow mitigation | Unsigned integer overflow mitigation |
| ----                 | ----                               | ----                                 |
| -ftrapv              | Yes                                | No                                   |
| -fsanitize=undefined | Yes                                | Yes                                  |

Integer overflow is typically associated with signed integer overflow.

When does a package meet performance critical?  If it is not marked
cflags-critical or rustflags-critical.

The hardening benefits will include some execution-integrity mitigations,
some information disclosure mitigations, some denial of service
mitigations, and some data tampering mitigations.

Execution-integrity mitigations with LLVM CFI (and CET or PAC) will mitigate
against some unauthorized transactions in trusted compiled code.   If you have
CET or PAC, you can ignore the LLVM CFI requirement.  The LLVM CFI
requirement in this overlay only applies to ARCH=amd64 users without CET.

This overlay will set LLVM CFI default off.  Then, it will prioritize candidate
packages individually for those where costly or devastating unauthorized
transactions could take place.  Then, it will slow evaluate each candidate
package for LLVM CFI mitigation enablement.

The not safe for production sanitizers will default to opt-in in this overlay to
decrease the success chances for vulnerability scanning.  Users can choose to
opt-out and follow upstream's opt-out performance-first security posture.
However, there are trade-offs.  Many of the sanitizers mitigate a combination of
Code Execution (CE), Privilege Escalation (PE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data
Tampering (DT), Information Disclosure (ID) during runtime.  It is not clear why
it was an issue but the LLM did explain it clearly.  You should ask the AI.  I
don't disclose it here for security reasons.  Users can opt-out by setting
CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER to a lower multiple to exclude them.  This
opt-in/opt-out is a Faustian bargain.  If you opt-in, you lose.  If you opt-out,
you lose.  For opt-out, you accept many vulnerabilities with full & partial
attacker capabilities + performance increase.  For opt-in, you accept ID
leading to 1 concerning full attacker capabilities vulnerability + performance
penalty.  There are several non production sanitizers that have this issue.
There is a disable logging workaround to mitigate the latter case.

The UBSan minimal runtime will be default on in this overlay for hardened marked
packages.  UBSan will protect against some of each CE, PE, DoS, DT, ID before
they happen.  Only a few vulnerabilities will be blocked on the top 50
vulnerabilities reported per month ranking.

The HWASan will be optional but secure-critical may consider enabling this
sanitizer since many top 50 vulnerabilities reported per month rankings will be
mitigated.  To enable it, set CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER=3.0 for ARCH=amd64
or CFLAGS_HARDENED_TOLERANCE_USER=1.5 for ARCH=arm64.  For ARCH=amd64, this is
about -O0 worst case with heavy swapping.  For ARCH=arm64, this is about -O0
best case with light swapping to no swapping.

To get the vulnerabilities reported per month ranking, ask the AI/LLM this:

Give me the top 50 vulnerabilities with corresponding temperature based on
reported vulnerabilities per month sorted by reported vulnerabilities per month
and another column that list the corresponding llvm sanitizer to stop the
vulnerability. Allow for multiple sanitizer possibilities so that HWASan can be
used when just ASan presented. Give me the full list. The temperature should use
red, orange, yellow, blue. I only want the vulnerabilities from now to previous
year. The vulnerabilities should be deduped and unique only one cwe per row.
After that list is generated, create a separate list listing the statistical
frequency of sanitizers used in the first table and sort that bottom list by
frequency.

To get a nice table of vulnerability protection per sanitizer, ask the AI/LLM this:

Give me a y, n, n/a table of what would be protected for code execution,
privilege escalation, data tampering, information, denial of service for all of
the llvm sanitizers.  Also include performance impact as a normalized decimal
multiple per each sanitizer.  Also include llvm's status as y, n, n/a for
production use.  Also include practioners' y, n, n/a endorsement for production
use.  Also include minimum llvm runtime sanitizer implementations like
-fsanitize-minimal-runtime.  Give me the performance impacts for both amd64 and
arm64 and as a best case and worst case.

To get a nice table of vulnerability protection per `<flag>`, ask the AI/LLM this:

Give me a y, n, n/a table of what would be protected against for code execution,
privilege escalation, data tampering, information disclosure, denial of service
for `<flag>`.  Also include performance impact as a normalized decimal multiple.
Give me the performance impacts for both amd64 and arm64 and as a best case and
worst case.


While it may upset minimalists, this forced mitigation may prevent some classes
of real world cost loss.

The classes of software that will be forced hardening on can be found at
[cflags-hardened.eclass](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/eclass/cflags-hardened.eclass#L186)
under the CFLAGS_HARDENED_USE_CASES.  This class and the rustflags-hardened
eclass have @USER_VARIABLE marked environment variables which can be placed
as a [per-package env configuration](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.env)
or in [/etc/portage/make.conf](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf).

The overlay will fork some distro ebuilds to apply the `cflags-hardended`
and `rustflags-hardened` mitigations since the distro ebuilds do not do
a good job verifying that mitigations are applied to security-critical
packages.

The requirement is based partly on the overlay's maintainer shift towards a
more defensive posture on cybersecurity.

#### -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE integrity re-evaluated

-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE provides stack overflow and heap overflow protection for str*,
and mem* functions for packages that use GLIBC.  If compromised or not applied
carefully, it may result in a critical severity vulnerability.

-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE is like the poor man's version of ASan but limited to these
cases and not comprehensive memory corruption mitigation.  It is the fallback
when ASan cannot be applied.

##### Extra flags added fix lost fortify source integrity

When -O1, -O2, -O3 is added, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE's integrity may be compromised.

This overlay applies 3 sets of flags to ensure that the integrity of fortify source
checks and thunks are not compromised by compiler optimizations.

* Set 1 for trusted secure data packages.  95% Coverage
* Set 2 for practical security-critical packages.  99 Coverage
* Set 3 for theoretical security-critcal packages.  ~99 Coverage

Medium severity without sanitizers + SSP-strong,  Low severity with ASan + UBSan + SSP-strong

Doesn't -O flags achieve the same thing?  Yes but it doesn't give the fine
grained control compared to these sets.  The set is selected to counter the most
prevalent compromises with the most effectiveness.  With the -O flags, it
doesn't necessary follow that order.

##### BOLT/PGO is here stay in cflags-hardened contexts

There was some thought to remove BOLT/PGO in packages marked with
cflags-hardened to eliminate a source of -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE integrity loss.
After hearing the perspectives, it was decided it can stay.  BOLT and PGO will
still be a user choice.  It is not clear which opinion is correct and the most
secure.

There are two narratives in this Faustian bargain.

* PGO/BOLT will increase the attack complexity lowering the CVSS score.  The
  mitigation drops to almost half the CVSS score when complexity increased in
  this narrative.
* PGO/BOLT will compromise the integrity of -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE checks or thunks.
  It may override/undo the above Sets.  It may even prune the critical
  vulnerability check or thunk function.  When you remove the Set, you are
  allowing the attacker to do code execution and not halting it as intended.
  The CVSS score maybe drops a quarter in this narrative but estimated to be
  high severity.

#### Requirements

```
sys-devel/gcc[sanitize,vtv]
sys-devel/llvm
sys-devel/clang
sys-devel/lld
llvm-runtimes/compiler-rt
llvm-runtimes/compiler-rt-sanitizers-logging[production]

# Choose one for ASan/UBSan sanitizers support for Rust
# The -Zsanitizer option is only available for live ebuilds
=dev-lang/rust-9999
=dev-lang/rust-bin-9999

# For ARCH=amd64
llvm-runtimes/compiler-rt-sanitizers[asan,cfi,gwp-asan,ubsan,safestack]

# For ARCH=arm64
llvm-runtimes/compiler-rt-sanitizers[asan,hwsan,gwp-asan,ubsan,safestack]
```

They are required because it assumed that the vulnerability is unpatched and
the fix require these features to be present.

In addition, ARCH=amd64 users without CET must build and rebuild all packages
that use LTO with Clang or disable selectively LTO in to prevent building or
linking issues when LLVM CFI is being used.  LLVM CFI requires LTO to work.
There may be issues with static-libs.  If problems are encountered with
static-libs, the package should either disable static-libs or the static-libs
recompiled with with Clang only.  This is to prevent any link-time issues or
intermediate representation (IR) or LTO bytecode incompability since LTO will
use that information to IPO optimize (or finish compiling) in link phase.  The
eclass will require that -ffat-lto-objects be not used to speed up linking
and lower the size cost.  It will transfer two representations to the HDD, so
it is like worst case double the copy time with -ffat-lto-objects when
transfering the library which could be like for the static-library 1GB
without LTO and 2GB with LTO -ffat-lto-objects.

ASLR must be enabled for mitigation for sanitizers to prevent a critical
severity vulnerability.  These checks are verified in the compiler-rt-sanitizers
ebuild.

Users must use the same default compiler vendor when a package is using
sanitizers systemwide.  It is suggested by the AI/LLMs that you cannot mix GCC
sanitizers with LLVM sanitizers on the same package/project.  The overlay
maintainer opinion about mixing is to avoid the possibility symbol collsion
with wrong signatures in static-libs using different vendors.  The ebuilds
manage it with CFLAGS_HARDENED_SANITIZERS_COMPAT and eclass assist.  The users
must choose only one default compiler vendor via CC and CXX and discourage
switching between vendors via per-package flags for LTO, CFI, ASan, UBSan, etc.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Run failure #1 or broken decrypted login

A broken login may be encountered and cause a profile not to decrypt home as a
result of broken simultaneously use of ASan and UBSan with curl.

If an ASan-ed curl gets updated, it may complain with:

```
==<id>==ASan runtime does not come first in initial library list; you should either link runtime to your application or manually preload it with LD_PRELOAD.
```

Try doing a `source /etc/profile` to fix the issue temporarily.

Try emerging curl from this overlay with the fix or use the distro curl instead
for the permanent fix.


##### Run failure #2

If missing ASan or UBSan symbols are encoutered in the build system toolchain,
replace the broken shared library or executable using the distro tarball.

Only a few packages are affected

- app-misc/jq
- net-misc/curl
- dev-libs/jemalloc
- dev-libs/jemalloc-usd
- dev-libs/libpcre2
- dev-libs/libtasn1
- dev-libs/nxjson
- dev-libs/pugixml

The issue has been fixed by linking statically with the sanitizer libraries.
While the packages above were tested thoroughly with the test suite with
intra-package self testing, bugs in inter-package integration testing between
packages will appear randomly and unexpectedly.  This is why a slow rollout for
ASan-ed and UBSan-ed packages are used to catch inter-package bugs easily for
packages that may affect the @system set.  It is preferred to avoid
ASan-ing/UBSan-ing the @system set to avoid an unfixable @system or the compiler
toolchain, but it is not obvious sometimes if a package will affect @system.

##### Breaking Qt based packages at configure time

You can either make a copy of the ebuild to your local overlay and modify the
ebuild to set abort_on_error=0 for ASan and halt_on_error=0 for UBSan in
configure time check for ASAN_OPTIONS and UBSAN_OPTIONS environment variables.
Then, for src_test() make both variables 1.

or

Disable sanitizers for dev-libs/libpcre2 package with the following...

The CFLAGS_HARDENED_SANITIZERS_DEACTIVATE=1 and
RUSTFLAGS_HARDENED_SANITIZERS_DEACTIVATE=1 can be used to turn off sanitizers on
a per-package basis.  Some packages force using gcc or llvm to get the package
built and as a result force sanitizers on when they should be disabled.  These
per-package flags can be used to avoid incompatibility problems.  Add the flag
to the package and then rebuild the problematic package or deep dependency
causing the problem.

### 2023 policy

Due to recent hacking near the beginning of the year (or earlier) of a prominent
member of the open source community who happens to also use the distro, it was
decided to (1) add proactive scanning of malware for binary blobs and
Electron/NPM based packages; and to (2) add proactive scanning of Electron/NPM
based packages for session-replay dependencies or command line options that may
result in unauthorized screen capture that may steal sensitive information and
also scan for analytics.

To use the proactive malware scan, you must install `app-antivirus/clamav[clamapp]`.

The policy for suspected analytics or session replay is "deny" build and install.

It can be enabled or disabled using per-package USE flags or systemwide through
make.conf.  Examples how to do this are shown below:

```
# Contents of /etc/portage/env/disable-avscan.conf
# 0 to disable, 1 to enable.
SECURITY_SCAN_AVSCAN=0
```

```
# Contents of /etc/portage/env/allow-analytics.conf
# allow means continue build/install, deny or unset means stop build/install.
SECURITY_SCAN_ANALYTICS="allow"
```

```
# Contents of /etc/portage/env/allow-session-replay.conf
# allow means continue build/install, deny or unset means stop build/install.
SECURITY_SCAN_SESSION_REPLAY="allow"
```

```
# Contents of /etc/portage/package.env:
dev-util/devhub allow-analytics.conf
sys-kernel/ot-sources disable-avscan.conf
media-gfx/blockbench disable-avscan.conf
media-gfx/upscayl allow-session-replay.conf
media-video/sr disable-avscan.conf
```

### 2020 policy

In 2020 for this overlay only, it was decided that ebuild-packages would be
dropped or migrated into oiledmachine-legacy to ideally eliminate
vulnerable packages.

Packages are updated if a critical vulnerability has been announced.
Send an [issue request](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/issues)
if you find one.

Web engines and browsers such as firefox, chromium, webkit-gtk, cef-bin,
CEF/Electron web based apps, are updated everytime a critical
vulnerability is announced or after several strings of high vulnerabilties.

ot-kernel is updated every release to minimize unpatched 0-day exploits.  Old
ebuilds are removed intentionally and assume to contain one or an unannounced
one by comparing keywords in the kernel changelog with the
[CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses (2022)](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2022/2022_cwe_top25.html)
list.

Packages are updated based on [GLSA](https://security.gentoo.org/glsa) and
random [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) searches.

Any binary package with dependencies with critical or high security
advisories matching the version of the dependency will be mentioned in
the ebuild at the time of packaging.  Only upstream can fix those problems
especially if dependencies are statically linked.

Some packages or ebuilds may be hard masked in 
[profiles/package.mask](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/profiles/package.mask)
if the package still has some utility but unable to be removed, or
contains a known infamous critical vulnerability.

## PGO/BOLT packages

The following list contains ebuilds modified by this overlay with PGO (Profile
Guided Optimization) support or BOLT, with additional patches from others listed
in the metadata.xml.

* sys-libs/zlib (pgo)
* x11-libs/cairo (pgo)

Those suffixed with ? are still in testing or not confirmed yet.

epgo and ebolt means with a custom trainer which is usually interactive.

pgo and bolt means pre-selected trainer.

Typical use case training (aka custom trainer) is preferred to optimize cache
use and to minimize junk pages.

The ot-sources usually train with interactive training but can be performed
with automated trainer in [files/pgo-trainer.sh](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/sys-kernel/ot-sources/files/pgo-trainer.sh).
Training should include user-space apps used in typical use, which the automated
trainer may miss.

#### The estimated benefits

* PGO:  compiler(s) ~20% benefit; ~10% on average, ~40% outliers
* BOLT:  compiler(s) ~15% benefit

### EPGO

Some ebuilds will use 3 step PGO per emerge.  Others will use EPGO which
does 1 phase per emerge with the epgo USE flag.  No extra effort is required for
EPGO.

In EPGO, training is done passively.  Instrumentation is or optimized based on
rules or events.

Events triggering PGI (instrumentation):
- Different compiler signatures between PGI and PGO.
- Version bumps that cause breakage or internal dependency updates which are
typically minor versions.
- Forced PGI with UOPTS_PGO_FORCE_PGI
- Differences in {C,CXX,LD}FLAGS.  (via -frecord-gcc-switches tracking) [planned]

Events that may trigger PGO (optimized builds):
- Presence of a PGO profile
- Same compiler signature in PGI and PGO phases
- New patch releases

If a PGI event is observed, PGI takes precedence.

Packages that inherit the tpgo.eclass may skip to 1 step based on same
EPGO event rules.

### uopts per-package options and UOPTS flags

Additional packages that use the tpgo (three step PGO) and epgo (event based
PGO) have additional options that can be changed on a per-package level.

Details about setting up per-package environment variables see the
[package.env](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.env) link.

More details can be found in 
[epgo.eclass](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/eclass/epgo.eclass)
[tpgo.eclass](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/eclass/tpgo.eclass)
[ebolt.eclass](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/eclass/ebolt.eclass)
[tbolt.eclass](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay/blob/master/eclass/tbolt.eclass)

USE flags:

* epgo - Build with 1 step PGO in one emerge
* pgo - Build with three step 3 PGO in one emerge
* ebolt - Build with 1 step BOLT in one emerge
* bolt - Build with three step 3 BOLT in one emerge

No stripping BOLT:

BOLTed binaries should never be STRIPed of .bolt.org* sections.  If you see that
portage did strip add either FEATURES="${FEATURES} nostrip" on a per-package
level or modify the portage package with a per-package patch to with
`-w -K .bolt.org*` changes with the DEF_STRIP_FLAGS variable in
[estrip](https://github.com/gentoo/portage/blob/master/bin/estrip#L177)
or
in installed version `${EPREFIX}/usr/lib/portage/${EPYTHON}/estrip` (see also:
`equery f estrip | grep python`).  To prevent segfaults, we set STRIP=true
in the eclass but from experience, it may not always work.

#### PGO environment variables

UOPTS_PGO_FORCE_PGI - 1 to reset to PGI temporarily.  Remember to remove the
flag or set it to 0 after being PGIed.  If build-time is unreliable for PGO, try
setting it to 1.

UOPTS_PGO_PROFILES_DIR - Change the default PGO profile directory.  The default
is `/var/lib/pgo-profiles`.  You may delete individual profiles to reset the PGO
process.

UOPTS_PGO_PORTABLE - 1 to build untouched functions optimized for speed, 0 to
retain untouched functions as optimized for size.

UOPTS_PGO_EVENT_BASED - 1 to build untouch event handler functions optimized for
speed, 0 to retain untouched functions as optimized for size.  Do not use unless
you encounter a performance regression.

UOPTS_GROUP - the name of the group allowed to access and edit the PGO
profile.

#### BOLT environment variables

BOLTFLAGS - Same as UOPTS_BOLT_OPTIMIZATIONS with the same requirements.
It is like the analog to CFLAGS but for llvm-bolt.

UOPTS_BOLT_FORCE_INST - 1 to reset to INST temporarily.

UOPTS_BOLT_HUGIFY - 1 to enable hugify to minimize iTLB misses with large
libraries and executables, 0 to disable.  Hugify is not compatible with
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT.  The optimization only applies to hot code not data sections
(e.g. data tables, text, art assets).  At this time, the UOPTS_BOLT_HUGIFY_SIZE
threshold value in the *bolt eclasses will determine when the benefits of hugify
is allowed and it is not clear due to the lack of experimental analysis or
research paper by upstream of size of the executable or shared object is needed
to gain a benefit.  (EXPERIMENTAL, amd64 only)

UOPTS_BOLT_OPTIMIZATIONS - Optimization flags to pass to llvm-bolt, overriding
the defaults.
(It is preferred to change this on a
[per package env](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.env)
level instead of systemwide via /etc/portage/make.conf.  To see more
optimizations, do `llvm-bolt --help`.)

UOPTS_BOLT_PROFILES_DIR - Change the default BOLT profile directory.

UOPTS_BOLT_SLOT - force to use a particular LLVM slot number to maintain
compatibility with the BOLT profile.

UOPTS_GROUP - the name of the group allowed to access and edit the
BOLT profile.

### EPGO/EBOLT profile permissions

(This section is tentative.  It's still in testing/development.)

Before using ebolt or epgo some environment variables and user groups must
be created for the shared EPGO/EBOLT profile.  For example the following
files could be added/changes for ebolt/epgo:

```
Contents of /etc/portage/env/uopts_x.conf:
# For PGO/BOLT training on X
# Choose a non-root user:group to perform PGO/BOLT training.
UOPTS_USER="johndoe"
UOPTS_GROUP="johndoe"
```

```
Contents of /etc/portage/env/uopts_wayland.conf:
# For PGO/BOLT training on Wayland
# Choose a non-root user:group to perform PGO/BOLT training.
UOPTS_USER="johndoe"
UOPTS_GROUP="johndoe"
```

```
Contents of /etc/portage/env/uopts_portage.conf:
# For PGO/BOLT training within emerge (aka the portage package manager)
UOPTS_USER="portage" # A non-root user to perform PGO/BOLT training.
UOPTS_GROUP="portage"
```

```
Contents of /etc/portage/env/package.env:
llvm-core/llvm uopts_portage.conf
media-libs/mesa uopts_x.conf
games-fps/foo uopts_x.conf
games-fps/bar uopts_wayland.conf
```

You may use "users" or "uopts" if you do not have a physical multiuser.
It is only an issue if there is a vulnerability in gcc/clang when reading
PGO/BOLT profiles because the PGO/BOLT profiles are shared across users.

The permission affects folders that stores BOLT/PGO profile files
which the non-root user must write to.  Specifically, it pertains to
these folders assuming that defaults were used:
`/var/lib/pgo-profiles/${CATEGORY}/${PN}/${UOPTS_SLOT}/${MULTILIB_ABI_FLAG}.${ABI}${UOPTS_IMPLS}/`
`/var/lib/bolt-profiles/${CATEGORY}/${PN}/${UOPTS_SLOT}/${MULTILIB_ABI_FLAG}.${ABI}${UOPTS_IMPLS}/`

Currently using the limited user for the group is recommended to smooth things
out, but it may break on multiuser setup.  When doing epgo/ebolt in multiuser
environment, it should be done ASAP or during maintenance days if the package
is confirmed to break between multiple users.

You may skip the 3 steps for group changes below if using a non-root user
(ex. johndoe) when doing PGO/BOLT training in production.

To add both these groups:
```
sudo groupadd uopts
```

To add users these groups:
```
sudo gpasswd -a johndoe uopts
```
Relog for changes to take effect.

When you are running under the uopts group, you may need to do
`sudo -g uopts appname` instead.

### BOLT + PGO

Some packages may allow BOLT and PGO.  Upstream recommends building the PGO
build to completion first.  Then, do a BOLT optimized build.

Both BOLT and PGO each require 3 steps:

PGO steps:
- instrumentation (PGI)
- training (PGT)
- optimization (PGO)

- testing (usually optional for temporary data but required if package touches
saved user data and no BOLT steps performed.)

BOLT steps:
- instrument (INST)
- collection (aka training)
- optimize (OPT)

- testing (usually optional for temporary data but required if package touches
saved user data and PGO and BOLT steps performed.)

Follow the 6 steps from top to bottom to properly combine them if using epgo
and ebolt.  The ebuild has access to `emerge --config package_name` to optimize
BOLT instrumented ebuilds avoiding long compile-times.

The testing step is often ignored in documentation but there is a chance of
unintended consequences.  If a BOLT training fails/segfaults, it may indicate
that the optimized PGO build has a bug or BOLT instrumentation is buggy.  The
testing step is important to prevent further data loss or data corruption.
Usually the preferred testing is via the test suite or test USE flag.

For those that prefer three step, the same can be achieved with a shell script.
Try epgo + ebolt try something like:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Emerge dependencies first except for PN.
emerge -1vo PN
# You may try emerge -1vuDNo PN for deeper dependencies.

# Instrument for PGI only.
USE="epgo -ebolt" emerge -1vO PN

# Perform PGO training.
echo "done training?" ; read

#
# You can combine at this point.  It is interpreted as follows:
#
# 1. Optimize the build for PGO first.
# 2. Instrument the build for BOLT afterwards.
#
USE="epgo ebolt" emerge -1vO PN

# Perform BOLT training.
echo "done training?" ; read

# Optimize for PGO and BOLT.
echo "done training?" ; read
USE="epgo ebolt" emerge --config PN
```

For those that do 3 step with USE="bolt pgo", the uopts.eclass will
automatically handle all 6 steps if it fortunate enough to come with a trainer.

An ebuild package may have an optimize.sh script along side the ebuild to take
care of this.

### Custom trainer ###

Ebuilds that inherit tpgo or tbolt eclass can use a per-package custom trainer
script, similar to the ideas of a per-package patch.

Requirements

- A directory `/etc/portage/trainers/${CATEGORY}/${PN}`
- A main script `/etc/portage/trainers/${CATEGORY}/${PN}/main.sh`
- Proper permissions:  directories 755 or 750 or 700, data 644 or 640 or 600, scripts 755 or 750 or 700.
- Proper ownership:  root:root
- rhash installed
- Hashes stored in `/etc/portage/trainers/${CATEGORY}/${PN}/Manifest`

Manifest format:
```
DIST relpath1 byte_size1 BLAKE2B hash1 SHA512 hash2
DIST relpath2 byte_size2 BLAKE2B hash1 SHA512 hash2
...
DIST relpathN byte_sizeN BLAKE2B hash1 SHA512 hash2
```

relpath is the relative path to the file in `${WORKDIR}/trainer`.  The script
folder contents at `/etc/portage/trainers/${CATEGORY}/${PN}` will be copied to
`${WORKDIR}/trainer` and run from there.

Hashes can be obtain with the rhash package.

You can place custom assets, shell scripts, etc.  But the main.sh script
should be a bash script.
