Ebuilds that inherit npm-secaudit.eclass, electron-apps.eclass,
npm-utils.eclass and emerged to completion at and before 2020-07-19 are affected
that prevent package removal and go into infinite loop.

Emerge does not use the absolute image of functions in
${OVERLAY_DIR}/eclass/{npm-utils,npm-secaudit,electron-app}.eclass containing
the fixed versions but rather bad cached versions stored in
/var/db/pkg/${CATEGORY}/${P}/environment.bz2 making it difficult to remove
the package.

To list affected installed packages:

grep -l -r -e "NPM_SECAUDIT" -e "ELECTRON_APP" -e "NPM_UTILS_" /var/db/pkg/


To fix the problem:

# rm -rf /usr/lib{64,32}/node/${P}
# rm -rf /var/db/pkg/${CATEGORY}/${P}

Re-emerge the package again.


Mutex lock directories named mutex-editing-pkg_db, mutex-editing-emerge-sets-db
in /dev/shm may need to be removed.
