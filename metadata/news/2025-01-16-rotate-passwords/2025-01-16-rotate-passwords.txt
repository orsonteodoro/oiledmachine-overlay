gui-apps/windowpet references tauri-plugin-autostart-api.  There is a
security advisory for the tauri-plugin-autostart-api dependency issued
Dec 19, 2024.

https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-32xm-jpw6-7frx

All passwords used on that machine with windowpet should be changed.

The advisory recommends to generate password on a different computer.

I extend the advice to include that each account have unique passwords that
should be created from a password generator for each account.  If a
password cannot be generated, it is recommended to use a 11 dice words password.
For single sign on password, with expired capabilities, the token should be
expired per month for frequently used passwords for easier recovery and to
top the attack from using that password after expired.  In addition, accounts
should add 2 or 3 factor authentication to highly valued accounts.  For keys
with revoke capabilities, it is best to revoke those keys also.

The computer should be clean formatted as a precaution.

The windowpet package has been introduced in this overlay on Dec 15, 2023
on with 32ef0d14a7ee69d66e7bc984591ccbed51868d1f commit referencing the
plugin.

The package gui-apps/windowpet has been removed from this repo to
prevent access to tauri-plugin-autostart-api package.

The npm team stated that they removed the plugin at
https://www.npmjs.com/package/tauri-plugin-autostart-api
but the lockfiles bypass this and download directly from the repo.

The repo tauri-plugin-autostart-api has not been deleted.  Usually the
repo will be taken offline by the service.  This could mean that the
advisory is doubious or false positive.  Since the repo and source
is open, it is not clear what exactly triggered the advisory.
