To test:

Make sure the xpra proxy server(s) are up and that you have the DISPLAY for
that was assiged to the xpra proxy server and spawned Xvfb at a future time.

Run a program on the Xvfb:
xpra start --start=xfce4-terminal :14500 # replacing 14500 with the value of DISPLAY

To attach to that you do:
xpra attach :14500
