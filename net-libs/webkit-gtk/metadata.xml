    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    The purpose of this ebuild fork was originally to provide multilib support
    for the ebuild fork for the surf web browser on the oiledmachine-overlay.
    Currently the motivations are to provide latest stable as quickly as possible
    for security reasons and expose more options related to performance or next
    generation of web standards.


    Release branches

    2.38.x - Stable branch (A new minor version every 6 months)
    2.39.x - Unstable branch (Preview)
    2.39.90+ - Unstable branch (Undergoing stabilization)


    Build time environment variables:

    CUSTOM_PAGE_SIZE -- This value should match kernel value for consistency
    reasons.  4, 16, 64 are common values.  Based on the assert, it is safe to
    have the current kernel page size less than or equal to CUSTOM_PAGE_SIZE.
    If the current page size is greater than CUSTOM_PAGE_SIZE it will result in
    a forced crash if asserts are enabled.  It should be the same CHOST that
    will run these libraries if cross compiling.  For more details, see

    EPGO (Event Based PGO)

    PGO is event based.  You can use gcc or clang.  I call it 1 step PGO (but
    dragged out over time).  EPGO is a more sane approach than what is promoted
    and used by the distro when it comes to packages with very high estimated
    lines of code of 20 EMLOC to +100 EMLOC that imply hours of build time
    cost.

    Motivations to integrate the EPGO technique again are long build times,
    difficult to use auto trainers, vulnerabilities that force rebuilds, 
    questionable headless training culling/cheating possibility (for maybe to
    save battery life), etc.

    The vulnerability one is the biggest one.  We do not want to overinvest time
    on 3 step PGO to end up tossing it out on the same day.

    Status: WIP (Work in Progress)


    Basic info

      PGI is an instrumented build designed to collect information.

      PGT is the training step.

      PGO is the optimized build.  On average 10% performance gains observed
      in many PGOed apps, but may have 40% in some use cases like QPS (queries
      per second) or throughput on rare cases.

      1-2-3 simple right.

      PGI transitions to PGT transitions to PGO.


    PGO training

      The preference is for real world training.  You can use a trainer but it
      should reflect typical use by you.

      Web benchmarks can be found on the web.  These can be used to train.  It
      is preferred not to use them because it can mess up the use efficiency
      of the CPU cache by enlarging code that shouldn't be.  This is why we
      prefer event based real world PGO profiling.


    Events or rules


      If the compilers when entering PGO are not the same as PGI, PGI is
      required.  The reason why is because the compiler may not recognize the
      same profile version.

      If the major and minor is the same between PGI and entering PGO, you may
      be allowed use PGO.

      The minimal required for training is opening a webkit-gtk based
      application.

      Upon re-emerging, sometimes it will say you can do PGO or sometimes it may
      say you need to do PGI.  This means that the ebuilds are on autopilot
      and will think it out for you when PGOing.  No rules have to be
      remembered by you.

      Immediately after every new PGI build, the existing PGI profile is
      wiped.  This is to prevent mixing same versions in the same data profile
      directory.

      A version with a different API versions will have different PGO profiles.
      Reason why is because of the possiblility of different codepaths enabled
      and possibility of different USE flags.

      A PGOed build cannot continue to collect and generate more PGO training
      data.  To restart all over you must wipe the training data, see the
      ebuild for the paths to the PGO training data.

      It is recommended to emerge as normally.  This gives time to enjoy the
      product based on WebKitGTK and at the same time passively train.  The
      state transition period is set by you.  You can push the states
      forward within the same day or 2, or you can wait upon each new release.
      The idea with delayed (per new release) is to do 1 step PGO every time
      instead of 3 step PGO every time you emerge.
