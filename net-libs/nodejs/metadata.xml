		This is an ebuild fork for Node.js with SLOT support.

		Ebuild planned support is LTS major version support only,
		but version 10 will be hardmasked since Python 2.7 is 
		End Of Life (EOL), meaning that security updates for
		Python 2.7 has ended.

		LTS will allow casual developers and non rolling release
		cycle packages a chance to stay in the ebuild ecosystem.

		More info about LTS versions see:
		https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

		v10 EOL is 2021-04-30
		v12 EOL is 2022-04-30
		v14 EOL is 2023-04-30
		v15 EOL is 2021-06-01
		v16 EOL is 2024-04-30

		Petition for SLOT support at https://bugs.gentoo.org/580698
		It has been an issue since 2016.

		The design is based on a multiplexer wrapper.

		Tentative additional packages:
			app-portage/nodejs (on the oiledmachine-overlay) for
				includes switch

		NPM packages that require multislot:
			Angular
			Vue.js

		The active implementation selected by app-portage/nodejs is
		granted /usr/lib64/node_modules which is symlinked to one
		of the directories above.

		It's recommended to install a package to the slot based on
		lowest required.  It's also recommended to use
		node_multislot_10, node_multislot_12, node_multislot_14 USE
		flags to pull the correct node version.

		Referencing /usr/includes/node is not multi-emerge
		or multi-compilation safe when packages with differing
		node_multislot_*  and requires a mutex in a new eclass, but
		runtime use of node is multi-process safe.

		It is save to use the same node_modules with different node
		but compliation must have special treatment.

		Certain USE flags should only be enabled for the highest
		SLOT; otherwise, you will get a merge conflict.  They
		are noted in the use flag section.

		If you run /usr/bin/node without the environmental
		variable NODE_VERSION, it will default to node the
		selected active from eselect nodejs (or the major version
		contained in node_version.h from the active symlink.

		The NODE_VERSION valid values are 10, 12, 14 which
		are the Long Term Support (LTS) versions.

		Running NODE_VERSION=10 /usr/bin/node --version
		will show you node10's version.
