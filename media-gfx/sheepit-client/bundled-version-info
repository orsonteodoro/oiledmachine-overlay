Comparison is done with sha256sum between the Sheepit service tarballs and tarballs from downloads.blender.org.

All tarballs are repackaged with renamed blender as rend.exe.

GLU versions based on build_files/build_environment/cmake/versions.cmake and the hash in the same file as
the cmake file, but the version for 2.80 is undocumented.
