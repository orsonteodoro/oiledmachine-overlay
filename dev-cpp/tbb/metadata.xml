    The oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) is a library that helps you
    leverage multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading
    expert.  It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts
    platform details and threading mechanism for performance and scalability.

    oneTBB library can be safely mixed with the TBB but with a oversubscription
    [more threads than cores] penalty.[1]

    The document "TBB Revamp: Background, Changes, and Modernization" describes
    the migration differences between TBB and oneTBB.[2]

    The purpose of this ebuild fork was originally to meet minimum requirements of
    either Blender or its dependencies.
