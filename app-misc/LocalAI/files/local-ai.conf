## Keep in sync from
## https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/blob/v3.8.0/.env

## Set number of threads.
## Note: prefer the number of physical cores. Overbooking the CPU degrades performance notably.
# export LOCALAI_THREADS=14

## Specify a different bind address (defaults to ":8080")
export LOCALAI_ADDRESS="@LOCAL_AI_HOST@:@LOCAL_AI_PORT@"

## Default models context size
# export LOCALAI_CONTEXT_SIZE=512
#
## Define galleries.
## models will to install will be visible in `/models/available`
# export LOCALAI_GALLERIES=[{"name":"localai", "url":"github:mudler/LocalAI/gallery/index.yaml@master"}]

## CORS settings
# export LOCALAI_CORS="true"
# export LOCALAI_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS="*"

## Default path for models
export LOCALAI_MODELS_PATH="/var/lib/local-ai/models"

## Default path for configuration
export LOCALAI_CONFIG_DIR="/var/lib/local-ai/configuration"

## Default path for system backends
export LOCALAI_BACKENDS_SYSTEM_PATH="/opt/local-ai/backends"

## Enable debug mode
# export LOCALAI_LOG_LEVEL="debug"

## Disables COMPEL (Diffusers)
# export COMPEL=0

## Enable/Disable single backend (useful if only one GPU is available)
# export LOCALAI_SINGLE_ACTIVE_BACKEND="true"

# Forces shutdown of the backends if busy (only if LOCALAI_SINGLE_ACTIVE_BACKEND is set)
# export LOCALAI_FORCE_BACKEND_SHUTDOWN="true"

## Specify a build type. Available: cublas, openblas, clblas.
## cuBLAS: This is a GPU-accelerated version of the complete standard BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library. It's provided by Nvidia and is part of their CUDA toolkit.
## OpenBLAS: This is an open-source implementation of the BLAS library that aims to provide highly optimized code for various platforms. It includes support for multi-threading and can be compiled to use hardware-specific features for additional performance. OpenBLAS can run on many kinds of hardware, including CPUs from Intel, AMD, and ARM.
## clBLAS:   This is an open-source implementation of the BLAS library that uses OpenCL, a framework for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs, GPUs, and other processors. clBLAS is designed to take advantage of the parallel computing power of GPUs but can also run on any hardware that supports OpenCL. This includes hardware from different vendors like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.
# export BUILD_TYPE="@BUILD_TYPE@"

## Uncomment and set to true to enable rebuilding from source
# export REBUILD="true"

## Enable go tags, available: p2p, tts
## p2p: enable distributed inferencing
## tts: enables text-to-speech with go-piper 
## (requires REBUILD="true")
#
# export GO_TAGS="@GO_TAGS@"

## Path where to store generated images
export LOCALAI_IMAGE_PATH="/var/lib/local-ai/generated/images"

## Specify a default upload limit in MB (whisper)
# export LOCALAI_UPLOAD_LIMIT=15

## List of external GRPC backends (note on the container image this variable is already set to use extra backends available in extra/)
# export LOCALAI_EXTERNAL_GRPC_BACKENDS="my-backend:127.0.0.1:9000,my-backend2:/usr/bin/backend.py"

### Advanced settings ###
### Those are not really used by LocalAI, but from components in the stack ###
##
### Preload libraries
# export LD_PRELOAD=""

### Huggingface cache for models
export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE="/var/lib/local-ai/huggingface/hub"

### Python backends GRPC max workers
### Default number of workers for GRPC Python backends.
### This actually controls wether a backend can process multiple requests or not.
# export PYTHON_GRPC_MAX_WORKERS=1

### Define the number of parallel LLAMA.cpp workers (Defaults to 1)
# export LLAMACPP_PARALLEL=1

### Define a list of GRPC Servers for llama-cpp workers to distribute the load
# https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/6829
# https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/rpc/README.md
# export LLAMACPP_GRPC_SERVERS=""

### Enable to run parallel requests
# export LOCALAI_PARALLEL_REQUESTS="true"

# Enable to allow p2p mode
# export LOCALAI_P2P="true"

# Enable to use federated mode
# export LOCALAI_FEDERATED="true"

# Enable to start federation server
# export FEDERATED_SERVER="true"

# Define to use federation token
# export TOKEN=""

### Watchdog settings
###
# Enables watchdog to kill backends that are inactive for too much time
# export LOCALAI_WATCHDOG_IDLE="true"
#
# Time in duration format (e.g. 1h30m) after which a backend is considered idle
# export LOCALAI_WATCHDOG_IDLE_TIMEOUT="5m"
#
# Enables watchdog to kill backends that are busy for too much time
# export LOCALAI_WATCHDOG_BUSY="true"
#
# Time in duration format (e.g. 1h30m) after which a backend is considered busy
# export LOCALAI_WATCHDOG_BUSY_TIMEOUT="5m"
