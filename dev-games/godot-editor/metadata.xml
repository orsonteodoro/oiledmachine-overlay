    Godot is a IDE for building video games capable of making 3D and 2D games
    in a day.  It can produce apps/games for desktop, mobile, VR (virtual
    reality), AR (augmented reality), MR (mixed reality), web browser games,
    multiplayer games, simulations for websites.

    It also has available game AI algorithms, physics engines, level
    generators.

    [1] Difficult if a person is not accustomed or not vibing with the style.
    [2] Removed in 4.x
    [3] Slow development cycle or 2 minor versions behind
    [4] Easy with the help of AI.  Predictive code completion is verified working.
    [5] Some platforms are noted as experimental or not supported.
    [6] Not portable if using SIMD or not using runtime detection
    [8] It varies based on the project size, team size, experience, quality
        standards
    [9] AI is less likely to help you or you lose AI code generation benefit
    [11] You can use multiple languages in the game.  Typically GDScript and C#,
         or GDScript and C++ are combined.  Use C# or C++ for performance-critical
         code.  Use GDScript for productivity-critical code.
    [12] A memory bounded problem.  C++ offers the lowest memory overhead of the
         listed languages.
    [13] Via OpenMP
    [14] Some AI can help with code generation.  Predictive code completion is
         missing or not operational for C#, so API class reference documents
         are essential for productivity.
    [15] Bindings available from the dev-games/godot-cpp package
    [19] The estimated time typically is related to project scalability.
         Popular languages in the industry reflect real world estimates.
         Languages that are not in the year range are unlikely to be languages in triple AAA titles.
         Year(s) indicates the average time it takes to build a AAA title, AI project.
         Week(s) indicates medium size projects, team projects, or casual game developer pace.
         Day(s) indicate simple games, and team programming contests.
    [20] Not all arches are verified tested.
    [21] Demos simple 2D games.
    [22] Not feature complete.
    [23] The demos look slow or skippy, less than 30 FPS
    [24] This is mostly a subjective syntactic comparison of bubble sort.  For
         some rows, the runtime performance similarity and memory safety
         similarity of compariable languages are noted.

    It has a built in drag-and-drop 3D level editor, IDE object manager,
    script editor.

    Prebuilt export templates allow for porting to mixed reality, mobile,
    desktop, web with minimal effort for use on game distribution or container
    distribution platforms.  However, some prebuilt export templates for x86_64
    Linux require SSE 4.2 or newer.  The workaround is to port the game as a
    32-bit x86 or to fork this ebuild with changes to produce a custom export
    template without SSE 4.2.  The standard export templates export code into
    intermediate bytecode.  The Mono export templates export code into
    intermediate language.  The standard export templates are interpreted and
    more portable, but the Mono export templates are JITed and ran in near
    native speed but less portable.  For GDNative scripted projects, use the
    standard export templates.  Porting to console is possible but non-free
    through third-parties

    Cross-compile notes:

      * Packages with godot-cross-* need to be emerged in crossdev context.
      * Packages with godot-template-* need to be emerge in native context.
      * See also metadata.xml in each package for details.

    See dev-games/godot-meta for cross-compile package status.

      delayed use after free detection, and not performing stack error
      detection.
