    For overview of Godot see either the website or dev-games/godot-editor.


    This is a meta package for installing Godot on this distro.
    Previous ebuild iterations built Godot as a monolithic ebuild.  These
    ebuilds now are split in order to increase code clarity and improve
    the tractable completion of each cross-compile port.
    

    Cross-compile or split ebuild design notes:

      * Packages with godot-cross-* need to be emerged in prefix (crossdev) context.
      * Packages with godot-export-templates-* need to be emerge in native context.
      * See also metadata.xml in each package for details.


    Ebuild development priorities with top highest (subject to change):

      * Re-add support for Mono (for Linux) in ebuild in a cleaner way [trivial]
      * Completion of prefix (crossdev) / export-template ebuilds for MinGW-w64 (64-bit) [trivial]
      * Completion of prefix (crossdev) / export-template ebuilds for MinGW-w64 (32-bit) [trivial]
      * Completion of export-template ebuilds for javascript [trivial]
      * Completion of prefix (crossdev) / export-template ebuilds for Android [least difficult]
      * Re-add support for GDNative (C++ bindings) in ebuild in a cleaner way [trivial]
      * Re-add support for Custom modules in ebuild in a cleaner way [trivial]
      * Re-add support for Mono (Cross) in ebuild in a tractable and most complete way [most difficult]
      * Completion of *most* prefix (crossdev) / export-template ebuilds for iOS (help needed) [most difficult]
      * Completion of *most* prefix (crossdev) / export-template ebuilds for macOS (help needed) [most difficult]
      * Completion of godot-ios-plugins (community help is needed) [least difficult]

    Some cannot be completed without community help.  Some require that
    specific hardware.
