    This ebuild fork will focus on PGO optimization and hardened flags.

    Assets for training are not provided.  You may provide
    your own by adding assets to the
    ${PORTAGE_DIR}/distfiles/trainer/assets/jpeg folder.  It is recommend
    to use your own images or public domain images for training.

    One may extend the training by providing a per-package
    userpatch with custom.sh placed in ${S}.  You should consider
    this option if you work with alternative input image formats for conversion
    or use color management profiles.

    Multiple trainer-*-pct-quality-baseline or
    trainer-*-pct-quality-progressive has been provided for flexibility
    on typical use but used typically for content creators.  75% is the
    default without quality setting.  Using trainers that don't reflect
    typical use may result in a performance regression.

    For custom trainer support see the README.md in the overlay.

      Runs training to simply batch decode assets from the pgo jpeg folder.  You
      may just provide this and skip the other trainers, but apps may use
      transformations as well so consider trainer-crop and
      trainer-transformations USE flags.
