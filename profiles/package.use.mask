# This list can be used to force off USE flags.
# ebuild developers, you may fix a feature by modifying /etc/portage/profile/package.use.mask
# and adding a row containing ${CATEGORY}/${PN} -use_flag.  This will remove the

# Developer note:
# without -<use> means block USE flag.

# Untested.  Please report back to remove hard use mask
