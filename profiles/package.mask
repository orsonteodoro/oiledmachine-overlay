#
# Ebuilds are planned to drop because of issues connected with
#
#   1. uncertain python quality targeting 3.10, 3.11 for very complex packages
#      depending on old python version (3.9) which is not EOL yet and required
#      for testing
#   2. Forced REQUIRED_USE blocking which cannot be disabled
#   3. _PYTHON_ALL_IMPLS (from python-utils-r1.eclass) bumping suspiciously
#      [back-to-back] faster than the EOL date (Oct 2025 for py3.9 and Oct 2024
#      for py3.8 compared to now (May 2023)) caused by commit d4f682f.  As
#      a consequence, ebuild devs are forced to use newer version or denied
#      updating on a current upstream supported release and raises quality
#      issues since no proof of testing on the distro side provided for these
#      unofficial patches for support for newer python versions.  This also
#      raises other big issues.
#   4. laziness of upstream to fix python compatibility for newer python in
#      related python test packages
#   5. a bad condition which can't be disabled in the link below
# https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/gentoo/blob/d4f682ffb030d6f8d8afac8438bda89bf1967dce/eclass/python-utils-r1.eclass#L171
#
# The solution is to fork the ebuild overlay which is not going to happen or
# delete or change to warning for the link above.  It will never be fixed
# because the same people or core devs keep breaking it.
