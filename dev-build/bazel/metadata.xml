  <longdescription>
    Bazel is a build tool with built-in support for building both client and
    server software, including client applications. It also provides an
    extensible framework that you can use to develop your own build rules.

  <!--

    oiledmachine-overlay notes:

    Added support for multislot

    Multislot reason:
    Changes to command line arg breaks backwards compatibility.

    Maintenance warning:

    If you do a version bump on Bazel, you need to redo the tarball snapshot on
    packages that depend on Bazel.  It is discouraged to do the normal patch
    version bump which has a heavy maintenance time cost.
